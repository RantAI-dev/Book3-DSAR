<strong>Chapter 21 of DSAR delves into graph traversal algorithms, essential for exploring and analyzing graphs systematically. It begins with an overview of graph representations, such as adjacency matrices and lists, and their implications for traversal efficiency. The chapter thoroughly examines Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), detailing their algorithms, key concepts like discovery and finish times, and practical applications including topological sorting and shortest path problems. Advanced traversal techniques are also covered, including Bidirectional Search for reducing search time, Iterative Deepening DFS for balancing depth-first and breadth-first advantages, Uniform Cost Search for handling weighted graphs, and A\</strong> Search for heuristic-driven pathfinding. Finally, the chapter provides a practical guide to implementing these algorithms in Rust, leveraging libraries like Petgraph and Graphlib, while addressing Rust-specific challenges such as ownership, borrowing, and error handling. This comprehensive exploration equips readers with both theoretical insights and practical skills to efficiently tackle graph-based problems.*

## 21.1. Overview of Graph Traversal
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graph traversal is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves systematically visiting all nodes (or vertices) in a graph. This process is critical for solving various graph-related problems, such as finding connected components, determining the shortest path in unweighted graphs, and solving puzzles like mazes. Before diving into the traversal algorithms themselves, itâ€™s essential to understand how graphs can be represented, as the choice of representation can significantly affect the performance and complexity of the traversal algorithms.
</p>

### 21.1.1. Graph Representation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
An adjacency matrix is one way to represent a graph. It is a 2D array where the entry at row <code>i</code> and column <code>j</code> represents the presence of an edge between vertices <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>. If there is an edge, the value is typically <code>1</code> (or the weight of the edge in a weighted graph); if there isnâ€™t an edge, the value is <code>0</code>. This representation is particularly useful for dense graphs, where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible, i.e., when the graph has many connections between vertices.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Adjacency Matrix Representation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
Initialize a 2D array 'matrix' of size n x n with all values set to 0
For each edge (u, v) in the graph:
    Set matrix[u][v] = 1
    If the graph is undirected:
        Set matrix[v][u] = 1
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn create_adjacency_matrix(n: usize, edges: &[(usize, usize)]) -> Vec<Vec<u8>> {
    let mut matrix = vec![vec![0; n]; n];
    for &(u, v) in edges {
        matrix[u][v] = 1;
        matrix[v][u] = 1; // Assuming an undirected graph
    }
    matrix
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, we define a function <code>create_adjacency_matrix</code> that takes the number of vertices <code>n</code> and a list of edges. It initializes a 2D vector (<code>Vec<Vec<u8>></code>) of size <code>n x n</code>, filled with zeros. Then, for each edge <code>(u, v)</code>, it sets the corresponding entries in the matrix to <code>1</code>. This code assumes the graph is undirected, so it sets both <code>matrix[u][v]</code> and <code>matrix[v][u]</code> to <code>1</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another common way to represent a graph is through an adjacency list. In this representation, each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices (i.e., vertices to which it is directly connected by an edge). This approach is particularly efficient for sparse graphs, where the number of edges is much smaller compared to the number of possible edges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Adjacency List Representation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
Initialize an empty list 'adj_list' of size n
For each edge (u, v) in the graph:
    Add v to adj_list[u]
    If the graph is undirected:
        Add u to adj_list[v]
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn create_adjacency_list(n: usize, edges: &[(usize, usize)]) -> Vec<Vec<usize>> {
    let mut adj_list = vec![Vec::new(); n];
    for &(u, v) in edges {
        adj_list[u].push(v);
        adj_list[v].push(u); // Assuming an undirected graph
    }
    adj_list
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, the function <code>create_adjacency_list</code> initializes a vector of vectors, where each inner vector will store the neighbors of the corresponding vertex. As it iterates over each edge <code>(u, v)</code>, it adds <code>v</code> to the adjacency list of <code>u</code> and, for undirected graphs, also adds <code>u</code> to the adjacency list of <code>v</code>. This representation is space-efficient and well-suited for graphs with fewer edges.
</p>

### 21.1.2. Traversal Algorithms
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Traversal algorithms are essential for exploring graphs, and they form the basis for many advanced graph algorithms. Two primary types of traversal are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), each with its own set of characteristics and applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Depth-First Search (DFS) explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure, either implicitly through recursion or explicitly by maintaining a stack. DFS is particularly useful for tasks like finding connected components, topological sorting, and detecting cycles in a graph.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
DFS(node, visited):
    Mark node as visited
    For each neighbor in node's adjacency list:
        If neighbor is not visited:
            DFS(neighbor, visited)
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn dfs(node: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, visited: &mut Vec<bool>) {
    visited[node] = true;
    println!("Visited node {}", node);

    for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
        if !visited[neighbor] {
            dfs(neighbor, adj_list, visited);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);
    let mut visited = vec![false; n];
    
    // Starting DFS from node 0
    dfs(0, &adj_list, &mut visited);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation, the <code>dfs</code> function recursively visits each node. It marks the current node as visited and then recursively visits each of its unvisited neighbors. This implementation prints out each visited node, illustrating the traversal order. The main function sets up a simple graph and starts the DFS traversal from node <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to maintain the order in which nodes are visited. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and is often used in scenarios like network broadcasting or solving puzzles like the shortest path in a maze.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for BFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
BFS(start):
    Initialize an empty queue
    Mark start node as visited and enqueue it
    While the queue is not empty:
        Dequeue a node from the front
        For each neighbor in node's adjacency list:
            If neighbor is not visited:
                Mark neighbor as visited and enqueue it
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn bfs(start: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, visited: &mut Vec<bool>) {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    visited[start] = true;
    queue.push_back(start);

    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        println!("Visited node {}", node);
        
        for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
            if !visited[neighbor] {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                queue.push_back(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);
    let mut visited = vec![false; n];

    // Starting BFS from node 0
    bfs(0, &adj_list, &mut visited);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, the <code>bfs</code> function uses a queue (<code>VecDeque</code>) to explore nodes level by level. It starts with the given node, marks it as visited, and enqueues it. The function then processes nodes from the front of the queue, exploring each of their unvisited neighbors and adding them to the queue. The main function initializes the graph and calls <code>bfs</code> starting from node <code>0</code>, printing each visited node in the order they are traversed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graph traversal algorithms have broad applications in computer science and related fields. For instance, DFS can be used to find connected components in an undirected graph by repeatedly calling DFS for each unvisited node, identifying all vertices reachable from that node. BFS, on the other hand, is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as it guarantees that the first time a node is reached, it is through the shortest possible path. These algorithms also play a crucial role in solving various practical problems, such as maze generation, puzzle solving, and analyzing social networks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, understanding the representation of graphs and the implementation of traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS in Rust is essential for effectively solving many graph-related problems. These foundational techniques provide the building blocks for more complex graph algorithms and applications.
</p>

## 21.2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a powerful and versatile graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It can be implemented both recursively and iteratively, each approach offering its own advantages. DFS is particularly useful in various applications such as topological sorting, finding strongly connected components, and solving complex puzzles like Sudoku. This section delves into the key aspects of DFS, explaining both recursive and iterative implementations, exploring important concepts like discovery and finish times, and analyzing the algorithm's complexity.
</p>

### 21.2.1. Algorithm Description
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The recursive implementation of DFS is straightforward and elegant. Starting from a source vertex, the algorithm marks the vertex as visited and then recursively explores each of its unvisited adjacent vertices. This recursive exploration continues until all vertices reachable from the source vertex have been visited.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Recursive DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
DFS(node):
    Mark node as visited
    Set discovery_time[node] = current_time++
    For each neighbor in node's adjacency list:
        If neighbor is not visited:
            Set parent[neighbor] = node
            DFS(neighbor)
    Set finish_time[node] = current_time++
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the pseudo code, the DFS function starts by marking the current node as visited and recording its discovery time. It then iterates over each neighbor of the node. If a neighbor hasn't been visited yet, DFS is called recursively on that neighbor. After all neighbors have been explored, the node's finish time is recorded.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of Recursive DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn dfs_recursive(
    node: usize,
    adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    visited: &mut Vec<bool>,
    discovery_time: &mut Vec<usize>,
    finish_time: &mut Vec<usize>,
    parent: &mut Vec<Option<usize>>,
    time: &mut usize,
) {
    visited[node] = true;
    *time += 1;
    discovery_time[node] = *time;

    for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
        if !visited[neighbor] {
            parent[neighbor] = Some(node);
            dfs_recursive(
                neighbor,
                adj_list,
                visited,
                discovery_time,
                finish_time,
                parent,
                time,
            );
        }
    }

    *time += 1;
    finish_time[node] = *time;
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);

    let mut visited = vec![false; n];
    let mut discovery_time = vec![0; n];
    let mut finish_time = vec![0; n];
    let mut parent = vec![None; n];
    let mut time = 0;

    dfs_recursive(0, &adj_list, &mut visited, &mut discovery_time, &mut finish_time, &mut parent, &mut time);

    println!("Discovery times: {:?}", discovery_time);
    println!("Finish times: {:?}", finish_time);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, the <code>dfs_recursive</code> function encapsulates the DFS logic. It uses several auxiliary data structures: <code>visited</code> to track which nodes have been explored, <code>discovery_time</code> to store when a node is first visited, <code>finish_time</code> to record when a node's exploration is complete, and <code>parent</code> to keep track of the DFS tree's structure. The <code>time</code> variable is used to incrementally assign discovery and finish times. This code starts DFS from node <code>0</code> and prints the discovery and finish times for each node, providing a detailed view of the traversal process.
</p>

### 21.2.2. Iterative Implementation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
While the recursive approach is intuitive, it can lead to stack overflow for large graphs due to deep recursion. The iterative implementation of DFS mitigates this by using an explicit stack to manage the vertices to be explored. This approach simulates the recursive behavior but with greater control over stack usage.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Iterative DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
DFS_iterative(start):
    Initialize an empty stack
    Push start node onto the stack
    While the stack is not empty:
        Pop a node from the stack
        If the node is not visited:
            Mark node as visited
            Set discovery_time[node] = current_time++
            For each neighbor in node's adjacency list in reverse order:
                If neighbor is not visited:
                    Push neighbor onto the stack
            Set finish_time[node] = current_time++
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the iterative approach, the stack manages the order of exploration. Nodes are pushed onto the stack, and the node at the top of the stack is processed by popping it off, marking it as visited, and pushing its unvisited neighbors onto the stack.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of Iterative DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn dfs_iterative(
    start: usize,
    adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    visited: &mut Vec<bool>,
    discovery_time: &mut Vec<usize>,
    finish_time: &mut Vec<usize>,
    time: &mut usize,
) {
    let mut stack = VecDeque::new();
    stack.push_back(start);

    while let Some(node) = stack.pop_back() {
        if !visited[node] {
            visited[node] = true;
            *time += 1;
            discovery_time[node] = *time;

            for &neighbor in adj_list[node].iter().rev() {
                if !visited[neighbor] {
                    stack.push_back(neighbor);
                }
            }

            *time += 1;
            finish_time[node] = *time;
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);

    let mut visited = vec![false; n];
    let mut discovery_time = vec![0; n];
    let mut finish_time = vec![0; n];
    let mut time = 0;

    dfs_iterative(0, &adj_list, &mut visited, &mut discovery_time, &mut finish_time, &mut time);

    println!("Discovery times: {:?}", discovery_time);
    println!("Finish times: {:?}", finish_time);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, the <code>dfs_iterative</code> function mimics the recursive behavior using a <code>VecDeque</code> as the stack. The stack is initialized with the start node, and the algorithm proceeds by popping nodes from the stack, marking them as visited, and pushing their unvisited neighbors onto the stack. The use of <code>.iter().rev()</code> ensures that the neighbors are processed in the correct order, preserving the DFS traversal logic. This iterative approach efficiently handles large graphs where recursion might otherwise be infeasible.
</p>

### 21.2.3. Key Concepts
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In DFS, each vertex has a discovery time and a finish time. The discovery time is recorded when a vertex is first encountered, marking the beginning of its exploration. The finish time is recorded after all the descendants of the vertex have been fully explored. These times are crucial for understanding the structure of the graph, particularly when analyzing the DFS tree or detecting cycles.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the provided implementations, the discovery and finish times are captured using <code>discovery_time</code> and <code>finish_time</code> vectors, respectively. These vectors are updated incrementally as the algorithm progresses, providing a complete timeline of the traversal process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
During DFS, edges are classified into different types based on their role in the traversal. Tree edges are the edges that form the DFS tree, connecting a vertex to a vertex discovered later. Back edges, on the other hand, connect a vertex to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree. The presence of back edges in a directed graph indicates a cycle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In both the recursive and iterative implementations, the parent vector (<code>parent</code> in the recursive version) helps identify tree edges. If a back edge is encountered, it connects the current node to an already visited ancestor, indicating the presence of a cycle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
DFS is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(V + E)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges. This complexity arises because the algorithm visits each vertex exactly once and explores each edge once. Whether using recursion or iteration, the overall time complexity remains the same, making DFS suitable for large and dense graphs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The space complexity of DFS, however, depends on the implementation. In the recursive implementation, the space complexity is $O(V)$ due to the recursion stack, where the depth of the recursion can be as deep as the number of vertices in the worst case. In the iterative implementation, the explicit stack also requires $O(V)$ space, but it avoids the risk of stack overflow, which can occur in deep recursive calls.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
DFS has numerous applications in computer science and related fields. One prominent application is topological sorting, where DFS is used to order vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge $u \rightarrow v$, vertex uuu comes before $v$. Another significant application is finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph, which can be efficiently done using Kosarajuâ€™s or Tarjanâ€™s algorithms, both of which rely on DFS.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to these, DFS is a powerful tool for solving puzzles like Sudoku. The algorithm can explore potential solutions by systematically trying and backtracking when necessary. This backtracking mechanism, inherent in DFS, makes it an effective strategy for exploring solution spaces in constraint satisfaction problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that forms the backbone of many advanced algorithms in computer science. Its ability to explore deeply and methodically makes it ideal for applications ranging from topological sorting to puzzle solving. The provided recursive and iterative implementations in Rust demonstrate how DFS can be applied in practice, with careful attention to key concepts like discovery and finish times, edge classification, and complexity analysis. Whether you choose the elegance of recursion or the control of iteration, DFS remains a critical tool in the modern algorithmic toolkit.
</p>

## 21.3. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices in a graph level by level. Unlike Depth-First Search (DFS), which dives deep into each branch before backtracking, BFS systematically explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This systematic exploration makes BFS particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as well as solving various other problems such as broadcasting in networks and finding connected components in undirected graphs. In this section, weâ€™ll delve into the details of BFS, explaining the algorithm with pseudo code and providing an implementation in Rust, while also discussing key concepts and analyzing its complexity.
</p>

### 21.3.1. Algorithm Description
<p style="text-align: justify;">
BFS starts from a source vertex and explores all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of vertices. It uses a queue to manage the vertices to be explored, ensuring that vertices are processed in the correct order. The algorithm also keeps track of which vertices have been visited to avoid reprocessing them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for BFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
BFS(start):
    Initialize a queue and enqueue the start vertex
    Mark the start vertex as visited
    While the queue is not empty:
        Dequeue a vertex from the queue
        For each neighbor of the dequeued vertex:
            If the neighbor has not been visited:
                Mark the neighbor as visited
                Enqueue the neighbor
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The pseudo code outlines the core steps of BFS. The algorithm begins by enqueuing the start vertex and marking it as visited. Then, it enters a loop where it processes each vertex in the queue by exploring its unvisited neighbors. These neighbors are marked as visited and added to the queue for subsequent exploration. The loop continues until the queue is empty, at which point all reachable vertices from the source vertex have been visited.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of BFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn bfs(start: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, visited: &mut Vec<bool>) -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    let mut order_of_visit = Vec::new();

    queue.push_back(start);
    visited[start] = true;

    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        order_of_visit.push(node);

        for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
            if !visited[neighbor] {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                queue.push_back(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    order_of_visit
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);

    let mut visited = vec![false; n];

    let order_of_visit = bfs(0, &adj_list, &mut visited);

    println!("Order of visit: {:?}", order_of_visit);
}

fn create_adjacency_list(n: usize, edges: &Vec<(usize, usize)>) -> Vec<Vec<usize>> {
    let mut adj_list = vec![Vec::new(); n];
    for &(u, v) in edges {
        adj_list[u].push(v);
        adj_list[v].push(u); // Assuming an undirected graph
    }
    adj_list
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, the <code>bfs</code> function embodies the BFS algorithm. The function takes the start vertex, an adjacency list representing the graph, and a <code>visited</code> vector that keeps track of which vertices have been explored. It returns a vector that records the order in which the vertices are visited.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The BFS starts by initializing a queue and enqueuing the start vertex. It marks the start vertex as visited to prevent reprocessing. The main loop dequeues vertices one by one, explores their unvisited neighbors, and enqueues those neighbors. This process continues until the queue is empty. The <code>order_of_visit</code> vector accumulates the sequence in which vertices are visited, providing a complete traversal order starting from the source vertex.
</p>

### 21.3.2. Key Concepts
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In BFS, the level of a vertex refers to its distance from the source vertex in terms of the number of edges. The source vertex is at level 0, its direct neighbors are at level 1, and so on. BFS ensures that when a vertex is visited, all vertices at the previous levels have already been explored, making it an ideal algorithm for level-wise exploration.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the provided implementation, the level of each vertex can be inferred by the order in which vertices are enqueued and dequeued from the queue. The queue ensures that all vertices at a given level are processed before any vertices at the next level are enqueued.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the most significant applications of BFS is finding the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph. Because BFS explores all possible paths level by level, the first time it reaches the destination vertex, it guarantees that this path is the shortest in terms of the number of edges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To extend the provided BFS implementation to find the shortest path, we can modify the <code>bfs</code> function to track the parent of each visited vertex. Once the destination vertex is reached, the shortest path can be reconstructed by tracing back from the destination vertex to the source vertex using the parent information.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how we can modify the BFS implementation to find the shortest path:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::VecDeque;

fn bfs_shortest_path(start: usize, goal: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>) -> Option<Vec<usize>> {
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    let mut visited = vec![false; adj_list.len()];
    let mut parent = vec![None; adj_list.len()];

    queue.push_back(start);
    visited[start] = true;

    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        if node == goal {
            let mut path = Vec::new();
            let mut current = node;
            while let Some(p) = parent[current] {
                path.push(current);
                current = p;
            }
            path.push(start);
            path.reverse();
            return Some(path);
        }

        for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
            if !visited[neighbor] {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                parent[neighbor] = Some(node);
                queue.push_back(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    None
}

fn main() {
    let edges = vec![(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)];
    let n = 7;
    let adj_list = create_adjacency_list(n, &edges);

    if let Some(path) = bfs_shortest_path(0, 6, &adj_list) {
        println!("Shortest path: {:?}", path);
    } else {
        println!("No path found");
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this version, the <code>bfs_shortest_path</code> function not only performs the BFS but also tracks the parent of each vertex to reconstruct the shortest path once the goal vertex is reached. The path is then traced back from the goal to the start vertex, reversed, and returned. If no path exists, the function returns <code>None</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
BFS is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(V+E)O(V + E)O(V+E), where VVV is the number of vertices and EEE is the number of edges in the graph. The algorithm visits each vertex exactly once and explores each edge exactly once, ensuring that every reachable vertex is processed in linear time relative to the size of the graph.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The space complexity of BFS is $O(V)$ due to the queue used to manage vertices to be explored and the <code>visited</code> vector that tracks which vertices have been processed. In the case of finding the shortest path, additional space is required for the <code>parent</code> vector, but this still maintains the overall space complexity of $O(V)$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
BFS has a wide range of applications in both theoretical and practical contexts. One of its primary uses is solving shortest path problems in unweighted graphs, where it guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges. BFS is also used in broadcasting and networking scenarios, where it simulates how information spreads level by level from a source. Another significant application is finding connected components in an undirected graph, where BFS helps explore and identify all vertices connected to a given starting vertex.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond these, BFS can be employed in scenarios such as maze solving, where it systematically explores all possible paths until the shortest solution is found. Its level-wise exploration makes it particularly suitable for problems where proximity or distance from a source vertex is a critical factor.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a foundational algorithm for exploring graphs level by level, making it invaluable for applications requiring shortest path solutions and systematic exploration. The algorithmâ€™s use of a queue ensures that vertices are processed in the correct order, maintaining efficiency and simplicity. Through the provided Rust implementations, BFS has been demonstrated as a versatile tool that is easy to understand yet powerful in its applications. Whether finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or exploring connected components, BFS remains an essential algorithm in the modern data structures and algorithms toolkit.
</p>

## 21.4. Advanced Traversal Techniques
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graph traversal techniques are essential for solving a wide array of problems in computer science. While standard traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) provide foundational methods for exploring graphs, advanced techniques such as Bidirectional Search, Iterative Deepening DFS, Uniform Cost Search, and A\* Search offer enhanced capabilities for specific scenarios. In this section, we will explore these advanced traversal techniques, discussing their principles, pseudo code, and Rust implementations. We will also delve into their applications, highlighting their utility in practical scenarios like pathfinding and heuristic-based search.
</p>

### 21.4.1. Bidirectional Search
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bidirectional Search is an optimization technique that speeds up the search process by simultaneously exploring the graph from both the start vertex and the goal vertex. This dual search approach effectively reduces the search space, particularly in large graphs, by meeting in the middle. This method is particularly useful when the search space is large and the goal vertex is known.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Bidirectional Search:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
BidirectionalSearch(start, goal):
    Initialize two queues: front_queue for start and back_queue for goal
    Initialize two sets: front_visited and back_visited to track visited nodes from both ends

    Enqueue start into front_queue
    Enqueue goal into back_queue
    Mark start as visited in front_visited
    Mark goal as visited in back_visited

    While both queues are not empty:
        Perform BFS from front_queue
        Perform BFS from back_queue

        If a common vertex is found in front_visited and back_visited:
            Return the path from start to goal
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this pseudo code, BFS is performed from both the start and goal vertices. The algorithm tracks visited vertices separately for each direction and checks for intersection between the two search frontiers. If a common vertex is found, the algorithm can reconstruct the path by connecting the paths from the start to the meeting point and from the meeting point to the goal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of Bidirectional Search:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::{HashSet, VecDeque};

fn bidirectional_search(adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, start: usize, goal: usize) -> Option<Vec<usize>> {
    let mut front_queue = VecDeque::new();
    let mut back_queue = VecDeque::new();
    let mut front_visited = HashSet::new();
    let mut back_visited = HashSet::new();
    let mut front_parent = vec![None; adj_list.len()];
    let mut back_parent = vec![None; adj_list.len()];

    front_queue.push_back(start);
    back_queue.push_back(goal);
    front_visited.insert(start);
    back_visited.insert(goal);

    while !front_queue.is_empty() && !back_queue.is_empty() {
        if let Some(path) = bfs_step(adj_list, &mut front_queue, &mut front_visited, &mut front_parent, &back_visited) {
            return Some(path);
        }
        if let Some(path) = bfs_step(adj_list, &mut back_queue, &mut back_visited, &mut back_parent, &front_visited) {
            return Some(path);
        }
    }

    None
}

fn bfs_step(adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, queue: &mut VecDeque<usize>, visited: &mut HashSet<usize>, parent: &mut Vec<Option<usize>>, other_visited: &HashSet<usize>) -> Option<Vec<usize>> {
    if let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
            if !visited.contains(&neighbor) {
                visited.insert(neighbor);
                parent[neighbor] = Some(node);
                queue.push_back(neighbor);

                if other_visited.contains(&neighbor) {
                    return Some(reconstruct_path(neighbor, parent, other_visited));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    None
}

fn reconstruct_path(meeting_point: usize, parent: &Vec<Option<usize>>, other_visited: &HashSet<usize>) -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut path = Vec::new();
    let mut current = meeting_point;

    while let Some(p) = parent[current] {
        path.push(current);
        current = p;
    }
    path.push(current); // Push the start or the end point

    if other_visited.contains(&meeting_point) {
        path.reverse(); // Only reverse if it was built from back to front
    }

    path
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, the <code>bidirectional_search</code> function initializes two queues and two sets to manage the search from both ends. The <code>bfs_step</code> function performs a single BFS iteration from one end, while the <code>reconstruct_path</code> function constructs the path once a meeting point is found. This method efficiently finds the shortest path by leveraging simultaneous searches.
</p>

### 21.4.2. Iterative Deepening DFS
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS) combines the space efficiency of DFS with the completeness of BFS. The algorithm performs a series of depth-limited DFS traversals with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. This approach ensures that all nodes are explored at increasing depths, making it suitable for scenarios where the depth of the solution is unknown.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Iterative Deepening DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
IDDFS(start, goal):
    depth = 0
    While true:
        result = DFS_Limited(start, goal, depth)
        If result is not None:
            Return result
        Increment depth
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this pseudo code, IDDFS starts with a depth limit of 0 and performs a depth-limited DFS. If the goal is found, it returns the result. Otherwise, it increments the depth limit and repeats the process until the goal is reached.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of Iterative Deepening DFS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn iddfs(start: usize, goal: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>) -> Option<Vec<usize>> {
  let mut depth = 0;

  loop {
      let mut visited = vec![false; adj_list.len()];
      if let Some(path) = dfs_limited(start, goal, adj_list, &mut visited, depth) {
          return Some(path);
      }
      depth += 1;
  }
}

fn dfs_limited(node: usize, goal: usize, adj_list: &Vec<Vec<usize>>, visited: &mut Vec<bool>, limit: usize) -> Option<Vec<usize>> {
  if node == goal {
      return Some(vec![node]);
  }
  if limit == 0 {
      return None;
  }
  visited[node] = true;

  for &neighbor in &adj_list[node] {
      if !visited[neighbor] {
          if let Some(mut path) = dfs_limited(neighbor, goal, adj_list, visited, limit - 1) {
              path.insert(0, node);
              return Some(path);
          }
      }
  }
  visited[node] = false;  // Unmark the node as visited on backtrack
  None
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>iddfs</code> function implements the iterative deepening approach, repeatedly calling <code>dfs_limited</code> with increasing depth limits. The <code>dfs_limited</code> function performs a depth-limited DFS, exploring nodes up to the specified depth. If the goal is found within the depth limit, the path is returned. This implementation ensures completeness and space efficiency.
</p>

### 21.4.3. Uniform Cost Search
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is an extension of BFS that takes edge weights into account. It maintains a priority queue (usually implemented as a min-heap) to explore the vertex with the lowest cumulative cost. This ensures that the shortest path in terms of total edge weight is found.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Uniform Cost Search:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
UniformCostSearch(start, goal):
    Initialize a priority queue with the start vertex and cost 0
    Initialize a set to track visited nodes and their costs

    While the priority queue is not empty:
        Dequeue the vertex with the lowest cost
        If the vertex is the goal:
            Return the path and cost
        For each neighbor of the vertex:
            Calculate the cost to reach the neighbor
            If the neighbor has not been visited or the new cost is lower:
                Update the cost and path
                Enqueue the neighbor with the updated cost
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this pseudo code, UCS uses a priority queue to explore vertices with the lowest accumulated cost first. It tracks the cost to reach each vertex and updates the path accordingly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation of Uniform Cost Search:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}

    }

    let mut cost_map = HashMap::new();
    let mut parent = vec![None; adj_list.len()];

    priority_queue.push(State { vertex: start, cost: 0 });
    cost_map.insert(start, 0);

    while let Some(State { vertex, cost }) = priority_queue.pop() {
        if vertex == goal {
            return Some(reconstruct_path(goal, &parent, cost));
        }

        if visited.contains(&vertex) {
            continue;
        }

        visited.insert(vertex);

        for &(neighbor, edge_cost) in &adj_list[vertex] {

                cost_map.insert(neighbor, new_cost);
                parent[neighbor] = Some(vertex);
                priority_queue.push(State { vertex: neighbor, cost: new_cost });

        path.push(current);
        current = p;
    }
    path.push(current);
    path.reverse();

    (path, cost)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, the <code>uniform_cost_search</code> function uses a priority queue to explore vertices based on their cumulative cost. The <code>State</code> struct represents a vertex and its associated cost. The <code>reconstruct_path</code> function constructs the path from the goal to the start, and the total cost is returned alongside the path.
</p>

### 21.4.4. A\* Search
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A\* Search is an informed search algorithm that combines the benefits of UCS with heuristics. It uses a priority queue to explore vertices based on a cost function that includes both the cost to reach the vertex and an estimated cost to the goal. This heuristic-guided approach improves efficiency by focusing on promising paths.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for A\* Search:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
AStarSearch(start, goal, heuristic):
    Initialize a priority queue with the start vertex and cost 0
    Initialize sets to track visited nodes and their costs
    Initialize a map to store the cost to reach each vertex

    While the priority queue is not empty:
        Dequeue the vertex with the lowest f = g + h
        If the vertex is the goal:
            Return the path and cost
        For each neighbor of the vertex:
            Calculate the cost to reach the neighbor (g)
            Estimate the cost to the goal (h)
            Calculate f = g + h
            If the neighbor has not been visited or the new cost is lower:
                Update the cost and path
                Enqueue the neighbor with the updated f
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this pseudo code, A\* Search uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from a vertex to the goal. The priority queue prioritizes vertices with the lowest estimated total cost, combining the actual cost and the heuristic estimate.

    }

    path.reverse();

    (path, cost)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the <code>a_star_search</code> function, the heuristic function guides the search towards the goal more efficiently. The <code>State</code> struct now includes both the actual cost and the heuristic estimate. The priority queue prioritizes states based on the total estimated cost. The <code>reconstruct_path</code> function constructs the final path once the goal is reached.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These advanced traversal techniques are widely applicable in various domains. Bidirectional Search is particularly useful for pathfinding in large graphs, where it reduces the search time by meeting in the middle. Iterative Deepening DFS is advantageous when the depth of the solution is unknown, as it combines the benefits of DFS and BFS. Uniform Cost Search is essential for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs, considering edge costs. A\* Search excels in scenarios requiring heuristic-based optimization, such as pathfinding in games and robotics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, these techniques enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of graph traversal, providing solutions for complex search problems by leveraging different strategies and optimizations.

## 21.5. Practical Graph Traversal in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s strong type system, memory safety, and concurrency features make it a compelling choice for implementing graph traversal algorithms. This section focuses on practical graph traversal techniques using Rust's libraries, with particular attention to Petgraph and Graphlib. We will explore how to handle graph data structures efficiently, manage ownership and borrowing, address error handling, and optimize performance through memory management and parallelism. Finally, we will discuss practical use cases such as real-time network analysis and game development.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Petgraph and Graphlib are two prominent libraries for working with graphs in Rust. Each library has its strengths and use cases, making them suitable for different types of projects.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Petgraph is a comprehensive library providing a wide range of graph algorithms and data structures. It supports various types of graphs, including directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted graphs. It is known for its robustness and extensive set of features, including efficient implementations of DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Graphlib, on the other hand, is a more minimalistic library. It is designed to be simpler and lighter, making it suitable for smaller projects or educational purposes where the full feature set of Petgraph might be overkill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When implementing graph traversal algorithms in Rust, several factors come into play:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Ownership and Borrowing: Rust's ownership model ensures efficient management of graph data structures, avoiding unnecessary copies and ownership issues. By leveraging Rust's borrowing rules, you can avoid common pitfalls such as data races and ensure that graph operations are performed safely and efficiently.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Error Handling: Rustâ€™s type system provides robust mechanisms for handling errors. For instance, disconnected graphs or invalid operations can be managed using the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> types, which allow you to handle errors gracefully and ensure that your graph algorithms are resilient to unexpected conditions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Memory Management: Rustâ€™s ownership model helps minimize allocations and manage resources efficiently. By avoiding unnecessary data copies and utilizing ownership rules, you can ensure that your graph algorithms are both memory-efficient and performant.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Parallelism: For large graphs, concurrent algorithms can significantly improve performance. Rustâ€™s concurrency features, such as threads and the <code>rayon</code> crate, allow you to parallelize graph operations, leveraging multi-core processors to speed up computations.</p>
### 21.5.1. Practical Use Cases
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Graph traversal algorithms have numerous applications in real-time systems, game development, and data analytics. For example, in network analysis, algorithms like BFS and DFS can be used to analyze network connectivity and find shortest paths. In game development, pathfinding algorithms such as A\* are essential for creating realistic movement and navigation behaviors. In data analytics, graph-based data structures and algorithms can reveal insights and relationships within complex datasets.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Petgraph provides a rich API for graph algorithms. Below is an example demonstrating how to perform BFS using Petgraph:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for BFS Using Petgraph:
</p>

</p>

## 21.6. Conclusion
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Embarking on the journey to master graph traversal algorithms in Rust will significantly enhance your understanding of both graph theory and Rust's powerful features. To deeply understand graph traversal algorithms, we provide carefully crafted prompts and self-exercises designed to explore fundamental, conceptual, and practical aspects.
</p>

### 21.6.1. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Begin by immersing yourself in the core graph representationsâ€”adjacency matrices and listsâ€”and understand how these structures impact the efficiency of traversal algorithms. Rustâ€™s memory safety features and ownership model provide an excellent foundation for managing graph data. For example, leveraging Rustâ€™s strong type system ensures that graph data is handled without the risk of undefined behavior or memory leaks, which are common pitfalls in other languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In implementing Depth-First Search (DFS), recognize that Rustâ€™s recursion limits can be a constraint, especially with large graphs. While Rust supports recursion, deep recursive calls may exceed the default stack size, so consider iterative approaches using explicit stack management. Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing rules help prevent issues like data races, which is particularly important when implementing concurrent or parallel DFS algorithms. Use the <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashSet</code> collections for efficiently tracking visited nodes and managing the stack or queue.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For Breadth-First Search (BFS), utilize Rustâ€™s <code>VecDeque</code> from the standard library, which is optimized for queue operations. This data structure will handle the level-order traversal effectively while maintaining efficient enqueue and dequeue operations. In Rust, ensuring that the BFS implementation is both memory-efficient and avoids unnecessary copies is crucial. Understanding how Rustâ€™s ownership system influences the management of graph nodes and edges will help in designing algorithms that are both safe and performant.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Advanced traversal techniques require a nuanced understanding of their implementations. Bidirectional Search, which reduces search time by simultaneously exploring from the start and goal, requires careful handling of two concurrent searches. Rustâ€™s concurrency model, with its focus on safe data sharing and synchronization, can be utilized to optimize this approach. Iterative Deepening DFS combines the benefits of both DFS and BFS, and implementing this in Rust involves managing iterative depth limits and efficiently tracking nodes across iterations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Uniform Cost Search and A\<strong> Search introduce complexity with weighted edges and heuristics. Rustâ€™s priority queues, available through crates like <code>binary_heap</code>, will be instrumental in efficiently managing node exploration based on cost. Implementing A\</strong> Search also involves integrating heuristics with the cost function, leveraging Rustâ€™s precision with floating-point arithmetic and ensuring that heuristics are well-defined to guide the search effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Throughout your learning journey, translate pseudocode into idiomatic Rust, making full use of Rustâ€™s error handling mechanisms to manage edge cases and ensure robustness. Employ Rustâ€™s profiling and benchmarking tools to assess the performance of your algorithms and identify potential optimizations. Engaging deeply with these techniques will not only enhance your algorithmic skills but also sharpen your ability to leverage Rustâ€™s unique features for efficient and safe graph traversal.
