<strong>Part III - Data Structures provides an extensive overview of essential and advanced data structures implemented in Rust, offering a thorough examination of how to manage and manipulate data efficiently. It starts with fundamental data structures, introducing arrays, slices, and linked lists while explaining Rustâ€™s memory model and standard collections. The section then progresses to elementary structures like stacks, queues, deques, strings, and bit manipulation, emphasizing practical usage and considerations. It continues with hashing techniques, including hash tables and cryptographic hashing, detailing their implementation in Rust and advanced applications. The discussion further explores tree structures, including binary trees and self-balancing trees, with a focus on implementation, augmentation, and practical aspects. Additionally, the section covers heaps and priority queues, detailing their implementation and practical considerations. It concludes with a comprehensive look at disjoint sets and graph structures, including union-find implementations, graph representations, and both basic and advanced graph algorithms, providing insights into their practical applications and optimization strategies in Rust.</strong>
