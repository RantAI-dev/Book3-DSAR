Welcome to <strong>Modern Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust</strong> (aka. DSAR), a journey crafted with the vision of redefining how we learn and apply fundamental concepts in the ever-evolving field of computer science. As the founders of RantAI, we embarked on this project with a deep-seated desire to unlearn, relearn, and master data structures and algorithms through the lens of modern technology and methodologies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In an age where traditional learning methods often tether us to rote memorization, we sought a new path. Our quest led us to harness the transformative power of Generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT and Gemini. These tools enable us to grasp and implement complex concepts with unprecedented speed and efficiency. By integrating AI into our learning process, we aim to transcend the limitations of conventional methods, allowing us to absorb and apply knowledge in a more intuitive and impactful way.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At RantAI, founded in Indonesia with a global vision, our mission is to make this book a state-of-the-art resource that empowers engineers to learn and excel at a pace that was once considered unattainable. Our approach is built on three foundational pillars: Fundamental, Conceptual, and Practical (FCP). This methodology ensures that our readers not only understand the core principles but also gain practical experience and apply their knowledge effectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We believe that mastering data structures and algorithms should be more than just an academic exercise; it should be a gateway to innovation and career advancement. To this end, we are excited to offer a pathway for those who excel with this book to apply for Software Engineer internships at RantAI. We hope this opportunity will inspire and motivate the next generation of engineers to leverage their new skills in real-world scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As you embark on this journey with us, remember that learning is a continuous and evolving process. Embrace the new ways of understanding and applying complex concepts. Let this book be your guide, as we explore and conquer the intricate world of data structures and algorithms in Rust. May this book inspire you to not only learn but also to teach and innovate, transforming the way we understand and apply data structures and algorithms in the modern world.
