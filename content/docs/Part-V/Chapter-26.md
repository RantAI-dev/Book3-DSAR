<strong>Chapter 26 of the DSAR book provides an in-depth exploration of matchings in bipartite graphs, delving into fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. It begins with a comprehensive introduction to bipartite graphs, where vertices are divided into two disjoint sets with edges only connecting vertices from different sets, and defines key concepts such as matchings, perfect matchings, and maximum matchings. The chapter then thoroughly examines the Hungarian Algorithm, renowned for solving the weighted bipartite matching problem with a time complexity of $O(n^3)$, offering methods to optimize assignment and minimize costs. Next, it introduces the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm, which efficiently computes maximum cardinality matchings with a complexity of $O(E \sqrt{V})$, leveraging augmenting paths and level graphs to enhance performance. The chapter also covers maximum cardinality matching, emphasizing the challenges and solutions in finding the largest possible matchings. Finally, it explores practical applications of these algorithms in job assignments, network flows, and resource allocation, and discusses optimizations and implementations for handling large-scale problems effectively. This chapter provides a robust framework for understanding and applying advanced matching techniques in bipartite graphs, integrating theoretical insights with practical considerations.</strong>

## 26.1. Introduction to Bipartite Graphs and Matching Problems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Bipartite graphs and matching problems are central topics in graph theory and have numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving various computational problems efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A bipartite graph is a special type of graph defined by its vertex partition and edge connections. Specifically, a bipartite graph $G = (U \cup V, E)$ consists of two disjoint and independent sets of vertices, $U$ and $V$. The defining characteristic of this graph is that every edge in the graph connects a vertex from $U$ to a vertex in $V$; no edge connects vertices within the same set. This structure ensures that there are no odd-length cycles in the graph. In other words, if a cycle exists in a bipartite graph, it must be of even length. This property is closely tied to the graph's ability to be colored using just two colors: one for vertices in $U$ and another for vertices in $V$. This bipartite nature makes it possible to perform various graph algorithms efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When it comes to representing bipartite graphs, two common methods are employed: the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. The adjacency matrix is a $|U| + |V| \times |U| + |V|$ matrix where an entry is set to 1 if there is an edge between the corresponding vertices and 0 otherwise. This matrix representation is straightforward but can be space-inefficient for large, sparse graphs. The adjacency list, on the other hand, lists for each vertex the vertices to which it is connected. This representation is more space-efficient and is often preferred when dealing with sparse graphs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Matching in a graph refers to a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex. This concept is fundamental in many applications, including job assignments and network flows. A perfect matching is a special case where every vertex in the graph is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. In other words, a perfect matching covers all vertices of the graph, pairing each vertex with exactly one other vertex. Not all graphs have a perfect matching; it is only possible if the graph has an even number of vertices and certain other conditions are met.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The maximum matching is defined as the largest possible matching in a graph, in terms of the number of edges it includes. It does not necessarily cover all vertices, but it maximizes the number of edges in the matching. The size of the maximum matching, or the number of edges it includes, is referred to as the cardinality of the matching. This is a key measure in various problems, such as in job assignment tasks where the goal is to maximize the number of assignments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Applications of bipartite graphs and matchings are diverse and impactful. In job assignment problems, for instance, bipartite graphs are used to model the assignment of jobs to workers, where one set of vertices represents jobs and the other represents workers, with edges indicating possible assignments. In network flow problems, bipartite graphs can model the flow of resources between two distinct sets, where edges represent possible pathways for the flow. In resource allocation, bipartite matchings help in optimally allocating resources to different agents or tasks, ensuring that the resources are distributed in a manner that maximizes efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding these concepts and their applications provides a foundation for solving complex problems involving network flows, resource distribution, and optimization. The properties of bipartite graphs and the nature of matchings are instrumental in designing efficient algorithms and systems in various domains.
</p>

## 26.2. Hungarian Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hungarian Algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm, is a powerful method used for solving the assignment problem in weighted bipartite graphs. Its primary goal is to find the maximum matching that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total profit, depending on the context. This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios like job scheduling, assignment problems, and optimizing transportation routes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hungarian Algorithm operates on a cost matrix derived from a weighted bipartite graph. The cost matrix is a square matrix where the element at row $i$ and column $j$ represents the cost associated with assigning task $i$ to agent $j$. The algorithm's objective is to find an assignment that minimizes the total cost across all assignments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hungarian Algorithm involves several key steps:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Construct the Cost Matrix: Start with a square matrix where each entry represents the cost of assigning a particular task to a particular agent.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Row Reduction: Subtract the smallest entry in each row from every element in that row. This step aims to create at least one zero in each row.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Column Reduction: After the row reduction, subtract the smallest entry in each column from every element in that column. This step ensures at least one zero in each column.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Cover Zeros: Use the minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines to cover all the zeros in the matrix. If the minimum number of lines is equal to the size of the matrix, an optimal assignment is possible.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Adjust the Matrix: If the minimum number of covering lines is less than the matrix size, find the smallest uncovered value, subtract it from all uncovered elements, and add it to elements covered by two lines.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Repeat: Repeat the steps until the number of covering lines equals the matrix size. The optimal assignment can then be read from the matrix.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a Rust implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm. This implementation includes constructing the cost matrix, performing row and column reductions, and covering zeros.

fn main() {
    let cost_matrix = vec![
        vec![4, 2, 5, 7],
        vec![6, 3, 2, 4],
        vec![7, 2, 4, 6],
        vec![8, 5, 3, 4],
    ];
    let minimum_cost = hungarian_algorithm(cost_matrix);
    println!("The minimum cost of the assignment is: {}", minimum_cost);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>hungarian_algorithm</code> function starts by initializing the cost matrix and the potential arrays $u$ and $v$, which store the dual variables for the rows and columns, respectively. The algorithm iterates through each row, performing reductions and finding the optimal assignment by adjusting the matrix based on uncovered and doubly-covered values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The time complexity of the Hungarian Algorithm is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in each partition of the bipartite graph. This cubic complexity arises from the iterative process of row and column reductions, covering zeros, and adjusting the matrix.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practical applications, the Hungarian Algorithm is valuable for solving assignment problems such as job scheduling, where tasks need to be assigned to agents in a way that minimizes total cost. It is also used in transportation and logistics to optimize routes and resource allocation efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, the Hungarian Algorithm is a robust and efficient method for tackling problems involving weighted bipartite graphs, providing optimal solutions with well-understood computational complexity.
</p>

## 26.3. Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm is a sophisticated method used to find the maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph. It is more efficient than simpler algorithms due to its use of augmenting paths and its dual-phase approach, which optimizes the search for these paths. The algorithm improves performance by reducing the number of augmenting paths that need to be found and processed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm operates in two main phases. The first phase involves constructing a level graph using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to discover augmenting paths, while the second phase employs Depth-First Search (DFS) to find and augment these paths in the level graph. These phases are repeated until no more augmenting paths can be found, ensuring that the maximum matching is achieved.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The algorithm can be outlined in pseudo code as follows:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Initialization: Initialize all vertices in the bipartite graph to be unmatched.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Phase 1 - BFS: Construct a level graph using BFS. The level graph partitions the vertices into different levels based on the distance from the unmatched vertices in the first partition. This phase helps in identifying potential augmenting paths.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Phase 2 - DFS: Use DFS to find augmenting paths in the level graph. For each unmatched vertex in the first partition, DFS attempts to find a path that can be augmented. Augment the paths found by DFS to increase the matching.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Repeat: Repeat the BFS and DFS phases until no more augmenting paths can be found. When no augmenting paths exist, the algorithm terminates with the maximum matching.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The time complexity of the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm is {{< katex >}}
$O(EâˆšV)${{< /katex >}}, where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices. This efficiency comes from the fact that each phase (BFS and DFS) is performed in $O(E)$ time, and the algorithm typically performs $O(âˆšV)$ iterations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a Rust implementation of the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm. This code includes BFS and DFS phases and demonstrates the algorithm's efficiency in finding the maximum matching.

In the <code>BipartiteGraph</code> struct, the <code>adj_list</code> maintains the adjacency list of the graph, and <code>left_partition</code> and <code>right_partition</code> represent the two sets of vertices in the bipartite graph. The <code>add_edge</code> method adds edges between vertices in the two partitions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>bfs</code> function constructs the level graph using a BFS approach. It initializes distances for unmatched vertices and updates them based on the adjacency list. The <code>dfs</code> function attempts to find augmenting paths in the level graph, updating the pairs and distances accordingly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>hopcroft_karp</code> method executes the algorithm by repeatedly performing BFS and DFS phases until no more augmenting paths are found. It calculates the size of the maximum matching based on the successful augmentations.
</p>

This implementation provides a robust solution to the problem of finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and practical utility in various applications like network design and resource matching.
</p>

## 26.4. Maximum Cardinality Matching
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maximum cardinality matching in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. It aims to find a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges, where a matching is defined as a set of edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. This problem has significant applications in areas such as scheduling, network flows, and social network analysis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph is a matching that includes the maximum number of edges possible. In a bipartite graph, the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other. The goal is to find a subset of edges such that no two edges share a vertex and the number of edges in this subset is maximized.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Two prominent algorithms for solving the maximum cardinality matching problem are the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm and the Hungarian Algorithm. Each has its own strengths and is suited to different types of problems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Although the Edmondsâ€™ Blossom Algorithm is extended to handle general graphs, it provides valuable insights into the complexities of matching problems in bipartite graphs. The algorithm deals with more complex scenarios, including finding maximum matchings in general graphs, not just bipartite ones. Its complexity, $O(EâˆšV)$, is generally less efficient than algorithms specifically designed for bipartite graphs but is versatile across different graph structures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm is specifically designed for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. It efficiently handles large instances of the problem by employing a two-phase approach consisting of Breadth-First Search (BFS) to construct a level graph and Depth-First Search (DFS) to find and augment paths in this level graph. This algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(EâˆšV)$, making it well-suited for large bipartite graphs where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Hungarian Algorithm, while originally intended for assignment problems, can also be applied to bipartite graphs. It finds the maximum matching by minimizing the cost of assignments in a weighted bipartite graph. Its time complexity is $O(n^3)$, where nnn is the number of vertices, and it is known for its application in optimizing costs rather than simply counting edges.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maximum cardinality matching has numerous practical applications. In scheduling problems, it helps assign tasks to agents or resources in a way that maximizes efficiency. In network flows, it aids in optimizing the flow through networks to ensure maximum utilization of available resources. Social network analysis uses matching algorithms to understand relationships and interactions between users, enhancing insights into network structures.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the <code>BipartiteGraph</code> struct, the <code>adj_list</code> holds the adjacency list of the graph, and <code>left_partition</code> and <code>right_partition</code> represent the two sets of vertices. The <code>add_edge</code> method allows for adding edges between vertices in these two partitions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>bfs</code> method constructs a level graph, which helps in finding the shortest paths to augment the matching. It initializes distances for unmatched vertices and updates them based on adjacency. The <code>dfs</code> method then searches for augmenting paths in this level graph and updates the pairs accordingly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>hopcroft_karp</code> method manages the overall execution of the algorithm by alternating between BFS and DFS phases. It calculates the maximum cardinality matching by counting the successful augmentations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This Rust implementation of the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm demonstrates an efficient approach to solving the maximum cardinality matching problem in bipartite graphs, offering practical utility in various real-world applications.
</p>

## 26.5. Practical Applications and Optimizations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Matching problems are pervasive in various fields such as job assignment, network flow, and resource allocation. Efficiently solving these problems often requires a combination of theoretical algorithms and practical optimizations. Below, we discuss these applications and optimizations with practical implementations.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Job Assignment:</strong> In job assignment problems, the goal is to match workers to jobs in such a way that the total cost is minimized. Each worker can be assigned to only one job, and each job can be assigned to only one worker. The cost of assignment varies depending on the worker-job pair. The Hungarian Algorithm, with its O(n3)O(n^3)O(n3) time complexity, is well-suited for this problem, as it finds the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network Flow:</strong> In network flow problems, especially those involving transportation and logistics, matching problems help optimize the flow through networks. For example, in a transportation network, goods need to be transported from multiple sources to multiple destinations with the goal of minimizing transportation costs or maximizing flow efficiency. The Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm is effective here, particularly in bipartite graphs representing the network, as it finds the maximum matching efficiently.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Resource allocation involves distributing a limited set of resources to various tasks or agents. For instance, resources might include financial assets, equipment, or personnel. The challenge is to allocate these resources in a way that optimizes overall efficiency or minimizes cost. Matching algorithms can help in this context by ensuring that resources are assigned to tasks in an optimal manner, considering constraints and priorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One way to optimize matching algorithms is by improving the underlying data structures. For instance, in the Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm, using a Fibonacci heap for priority queues can reduce the time complexity of the BFS and DFS phases. This is because Fibonacci heaps provide better amortized time bounds for priority queue operations compared to binary heaps.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Approximation Algorithms:</strong> In scenarios where exact solutions are infeasible due to problem size or computational constraints, approximation algorithms can be used. These algorithms provide near-optimal solutions with guaranteed bounds on their performance. For example, algorithms that approximate the maximum matching in polynomial time can be useful for very large graphs where exact methods are too slow.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parallel and Distributed Algorithms:</strong> For large-scale problems, leveraging parallel and distributed computing can significantly speed up computations. By decomposing the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved concurrently, one can reduce the overall computation time. Techniques such as parallel BFS or DFS, and distributed data structures, are employed to handle massive graphs effectively.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">I<strong>mplementation Tips:</strong> When implementing algorithms for practical applications, especially in the context of sparse graphs, using adjacency lists can save space and improve performance. Adjacency lists are more memory-efficient compared to adjacency matrices, especially when the graph contains fewer edges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, heuristic methods can be employed to handle practical constraints. For example, local search algorithms or greedy approaches can provide good-enough solutions quickly, even if they are not guaranteed to be optimal.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a Rust implementation that demonstrates an optimized approach to solving a job assignment problem using the Hungarian Algorithm. This implementation uses adjacency lists and includes some heuristic optimizations.
