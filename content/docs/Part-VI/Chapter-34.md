## 34.1. Introduction to String Matching
<p style="text-align: justify;">
String matching is a fundamental problem in computer science that involves finding one or more occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string. This problem has widespread applications across various domains, making it a critical area of study in algorithm design. In search engines, for example, string matching is essential for efficiently locating relevant documents based on user queries. Text editors rely on string matching algorithms for features such as search-and-replace, while DNA sequencing in bioinformatics uses string matching to identify specific sequences within long strands of genetic material. Data retrieval systems also leverage string matching to extract relevant information from large datasets. The importance of string matching cannot be overstated, as it underpins many technologies that are integral to modern computing, from simple text searches to complex biological data analysis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To fully understand string matching, it's essential to grasp the basic terminology used in this context. The string in which we search for occurrences is referred to as the <strong>Text</strong> (T). This text can be of arbitrary length and contains the data we wish to analyze. The <strong>Pattern</strong> (P) is the string that we are searching for within the text. The pattern is typically shorter than the text and represents the specific sequence of characters we want to locate. The process of locating the pattern within the text is known as <strong>Matching</strong>. This involves comparing the pattern with various substrings of the text to determine where, if at all, the pattern occurs. Understanding these basic terms is crucial for delving into the more complex aspects of string matching algorithms, as they form the foundation upon which these algorithms are built.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The efficiency of string matching algorithms is a key consideration, particularly when dealing with large texts and patterns. The <strong>time complexity</strong> of an algorithm determines how the running time grows with the size of the input text and pattern. For example, a naive approach to string matching might involve comparing the pattern to every possible substring of the text, leading to a time complexity of $O(n*m)$, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern. However, more sophisticated algorithms, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm, achieve much better time complexities by incorporating clever preprocessing and skipping techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to time complexity, <strong>space complexity</strong> is another critical factor, particularly in memory-constrained environments. Efficient string matching algorithms strive to minimize the amount of additional memory required, beyond the storage for the text and pattern themselves. The preprocessing time, which refers to the time required to prepare the pattern or text for efficient searching, is also an important consideration. Algorithms like KMP preprocess the pattern to create a partial match table, which speeds up the matching process but adds an upfront cost in terms of preprocessing time. Finally, <strong>matching time</strong> is the time taken to actually perform the search, once preprocessing is complete. Balancing these factorsâ€”time complexity, space complexity, preprocessing time, and matching timeâ€”is crucial in designing and selecting the appropriate string matching algorithm for a given application.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By thoroughly understanding the definition, importance, basic terminology, and complexity considerations of string matching, we can appreciate the challenges and intricacies involved in developing efficient algorithms for this fundamental problem. This knowledge serves as the foundation for exploring the various string matching algorithms and their applications in the field of data structures and algorithms, particularly within the context of Rust programming.
</p>

## 34.2. Classic String Matching Algorithms
### 34.2.1. Naive String Matching Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Naive String Matching algorithm is the most basic approach to the string matching problem. The algorithm works by sliding the pattern over the text one character at a time and comparing the pattern to the corresponding substring of the text. Specifically, for each position in the text, the algorithm checks whether the substring starting at that position matches the pattern. If a match is found, the algorithm records the position of the match; otherwise, it moves to the next position in the text and repeats the process. The main advantage of the Naive String Matching algorithm is its simplicity. However, this simplicity comes at a cost: the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \times m)$, where nnn is the length of the text and mmm is the length of the pattern. This quadratic time complexity makes the algorithm inefficient for large texts or patterns.

for i = 0 to n - m
    match = true
    for j = 0 to m - 1
        if text[i + j] != pattern[j]
            match = false
            break
    if match
        print "Pattern found at index", i
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn naive_string_matching(text: &str, pattern: &str) {
    let n = text.len();
    let m = pattern.len();

    for i in 0..=n - m {
        let mut match_found = true;

        for j in 0..m {
            if &text[i + j..i + j + 1] != &pattern[j..j + 1] {
                match_found = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if match_found {
            println!("Pattern found at index {}", i);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    let pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    naive_string_matching(text, pattern);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation, the <code>naive_string_matching</code> function iterates over each possible starting position of the pattern in the text. For each position, it checks whether the pattern matches the substring of the text starting at that position. If a match is found, the function prints the index of the match. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm's inefficiency for large inputs limits its practical use.
</p>

### 34.2.2. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an optimization over the Naive String Matching algorithm. The key insight of the KMP algorithm is that when a mismatch occurs, the pattern itself contains enough information to determine where the next potential match could begin, without needing to recheck characters that are already known to match. To achieve this, the KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to build a partial match table (also known as the prefix table). This table stores the lengths of the longest prefixes of the pattern that are also suffixes. During the matching phase, if a mismatch occurs after some characters have matched, the algorithm uses the partial match table to skip ahead to the next possible matching position in the text. This allows the KMP algorithm to achieve a time complexity of $O(n + m)$, making it much more efficient than the Naive String Matching algorithm, particularly for long patterns and texts.

<p style="text-align: justify;">

            i++, j++
        if j == m
            print "Pattern found at index", i - j
            j = lps[j - 1]
        else if i < n and text[i] != pattern[j]
            if j != 0
                j = lps[j - 1]
            else

fn compute_lps_array(pattern: &str) -> Vec<usize> {
    let m = pattern.len();
    let mut lps = vec![0; m];
    let mut length = 0;
    let mut i = 1;

    while i < m {
        if pattern[i..i + 1] == pattern[length..length + 1] {
            length += 1;
            lps[i] = length;
            i += 1;
        } else {
            if length != 0 {
                length = lps[length - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i += 1;

    let lps = compute_lps_array(pattern);
    let mut i = 0;

        }

        if j == m {

            j = lps[j - 1];
        } else if i < n && text[i..i + 1] != pattern[j..j + 1] {
            if j != 0 {
                j = lps[j - 1];
            } else {
                i += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    let pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    kmp_string_matching(text, pattern);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the KMP implementation in Rust, the <code>compute_lps_array</code> function first computes the partial match table (LPS array). The <code>kmp_string_matching</code> function then uses this table to efficiently search for the pattern in the text. When a mismatch occurs, the LPS array allows the algorithm to skip ahead in the text, avoiding redundant comparisons and greatly improving performance.
</p>

### 34.2.3. Boyer-Moore Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Boyer-Moore algorithm is another advanced string matching technique that optimizes the matching process by skipping sections of the text that cannot possibly match the pattern. It does this using two main heuristics: the Bad Character Rule and the Good Suffix Rule. The Bad Character Rule shifts the pattern to align the last occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern with its position in the text. If the mismatched character does not occur in the pattern, the pattern is shifted past the mismatched character. The Good Suffix Rule shifts the pattern based on the occurrence of substrings in the pattern itself. If a mismatch occurs, the pattern is shifted to align the next occurrence of the matched substring in the pattern with its position in the text. On average, the Boyer-Moore algorithm performs much better than both the Naive and KMP algorithms, with an average-case complexity of $O(n/m)$. However, its worst-case complexity is still $O(n \times m)$, making it less predictable in performance compared to KMP.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Boyer-Moore:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function BoyerMoore(text, pattern)
    preprocessBadCharacterRule(pattern)
    preprocessGoodSuffixRule(pattern)
    shift = 0
    while shift <= n - m
        j = m - 1
        while j >= 0 and pattern[j] == text[shift + j]
            j--
        if j < 0
            print "Pattern found at index", shift
            shift += goodSuffixTable[0]
        else
            shift += max(badCharacterTable[text[shift + j]] - (m - 1 - j), goodSuffixTable[j])

<p style="text-align: justify;">

</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn preprocess_bad_character_rule(pattern: &str) -> [usize; 256] {
    let mut bad_char_table = [pattern.len(); 256];

    for (i, &c) in pattern.as_bytes().iter().enumerate() {
        bad_char_table[c as usize] = i;
    }

    bad_char_table
}

fn boyer_moore_string_matching(text: &str, pattern: &str) {
    let n = text.len();
    let m = pattern.len();
    let bad_char_table = preprocess_bad_character_rule(pattern);
    let mut shift = 0;

    while shift <= n - m {
        let mut j = m as isize - 1;

        while j >= 0 && pattern.as_bytes()[j as usize] == text.as_bytes()[(shift as isize + j) as usize] {
            j -= 1;
        }

        if j < 0 {
            println!("Pattern found at index {}", shift);
            shift += if shift + m < n { m - bad_char_table[text.as_bytes()[shift + m] as usize] } else { 1 };
        } else {
            shift += usize::max(1, j as usize - bad_char_table[text.as_bytes()[(shift as isize + j) as usize] as usize]);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    let pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    boyer_moore_string_matching(text, pattern);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation of the Boyer-Moore algorithm, the pattern is first preprocessed using the Bad Character Rule to create a table that guides the algorithm in skipping sections of the text. The <code>boyer_moore_string_matching</code> function uses this table during the matching process, applying the Bad Character Rule and, optionally, the Good Suffix Rule to determine the optimal shift after each mismatch. This results in an efficient string matching process, especially when dealing with long patterns and texts.
</p>

### 34.2.4. Rabin-Karp Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Rabin-Karp algorithm takes a different approach to string matching by using hashing. It computes the hash value of the pattern and then iterates over the text, computing the hash value of each substring of the same length as the pattern. If the hash values match, the algorithm performs a detailed comparison of the pattern and the substring to confirm the match. The average-case complexity of Rabin-Karp is $O(n + m)$, but in the worst case, where hash collisions are frequent, it can degrade to $O(n \times m)$. Rabin-Karp is particularly useful for multiple pattern matching or when the hash function is well-designed to minimize collisions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Rabin-Karp:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function RabinKarp(text, pattern)
    pHash = hash(pattern)
    for i = 0 to n - m
        tHash = hash(text[i..i + m])
        if pHash == tHash
            if text[i..i + m] == pattern
                print "Pattern found at index", i
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
const PRIME_BASE: usize = 101;

fn hash(s: &str) -> usize {
    s.bytes().enumerate().fold(0, |acc, (i, b)| acc + (b as usize) * PRIME_BASE.pow(i as u32))
}

fn rabin_karp_string_matching(text: &str, pattern: &str) {
    let n = text.len();
    let m = pattern.len();
    let p_hash = hash(pattern);

    for i in 0..=n - m {
        let t_hash = hash(&text[i..i + m]);
        if p_hash == t_hash {
            if &text[i..i + m] == pattern {
                println!("Pattern found at index {}", i);
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    let pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    rabin_karp_string_matching(text, pattern);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rabin-Karp implementation, the <code>hash</code> function computes the hash value of a string using a simple polynomial hash function with a prime base. The <code>rabin_karp_string_matching</code> function iterates over the text, computing the hash value of each substring and comparing it to the hash value of the pattern. If the hash values match, a further comparison is made to confirm the match. This approach can be very efficient when the hash function minimizes collisions, making Rabin-Karp particularly suitable for applications where multiple patterns need to be matched or when the text is large.
</p>

## 34.3. Advanced String Matching Algorithms
### 34.3.1. Suffix Trees
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A Suffix Tree is a powerful data structure that represents all suffixes of a given text in a compressed trie format, allowing for efficient substring searches and various complex string queries. The main advantage of a suffix tree is its ability to perform searches in linear time with respect to the length of the pattern, making it ideal for applications such as finding the longest repeated substring, identifying unique substrings, or solving the longest common substring problem between two strings. The construction of a suffix tree can be achieved in $O(n)$ time, where nnn is the length of the text, using Ukkonen's algorithm. Once the suffix tree is constructed, searching for a pattern of length mmm can be done in $O(m)$ time by traversing the tree from the root, following the edges that match the characters of the pattern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Suffix Tree Construction:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function BuildSuffixTree(text)
    root = new Node()
    for i = 0 to n - 1
        suffix = text[i..n]
        currentNode = root
        for character in suffix
            if character exists in currentNode's children
                currentNode = currentNode.children[character]
            else
                newNode = new Node()
                currentNode.children[character] = newNode
                currentNode = newNode
    return root
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Default)]
struct Node {
    children: HashMap<char, Node>,
}

fn build_suffix_tree(text: &str) -> Node {
    let mut root = Node::default();

    for i in 0..text.len() {
        let suffix = &text[i..];
        let mut current_node = &mut root;

        for c in suffix.chars() {
            current_node = current_node.children.entry(c).or_insert_with(Node::default);
        }
    }

    root
}

fn search_suffix_tree(node: &Node, pattern: &str) -> bool {
    let mut current_node = node;

    for c in pattern.chars() {
        match current_node.children.get(&c) {
            Some(next_node) => current_node = next_node,
            None => return false,
        }
    }

    true
}

fn main() {
    let text = "banana";
    let pattern = "ana";
    let suffix_tree = build_suffix_tree(text);

    if search_suffix_tree(&suffix_tree, pattern) {
        println!("Pattern '{}' found in text '{}'", pattern, text);
    } else {
        println!("Pattern '{}' not found in text '{}'", pattern, text);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this Rust implementation, the <code>build_suffix_tree</code> function constructs a suffix tree for the given text. Each suffix of the text is inserted into the tree by iterating through its characters and either adding new nodes or following existing paths in the tree. The <code>search_suffix_tree</code> function then searches for a pattern in the constructed suffix tree, returning true if the pattern exists and false otherwise. The efficiency of this approach makes it suitable for tasks requiring fast and repeated substring queries.
</p>

### 34.3.2. Suffix Arrays
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A Suffix Array is a more space-efficient alternative to the suffix tree. It is an array of all suffixes of a text, sorted in lexicographical order. The primary advantage of the suffix array is its simplicity and the fact that it can be combined with a Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array to perform various tasks efficiently, such as finding the longest repeated substring or performing quick substring searches. Constructing a suffix array typically takes $O(n \log n)$ time due to the sorting step, and searching for a pattern using binary search on the suffix array takes $O(m \log n)$, where mmm is the length of the pattern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Suffix Array Construction:

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}

        for character in suffix
            if character exists in currentNode's children
                currentNode = currentNode.children[character]
            else
                newNode = new Node()
                currentNode.children[character] = newNode
                currentNode = newNode
    return root

    for i in 0..text.len() {
        let suffix = &text[i..];
        let mut current_node = &mut root;

        for c in suffix.chars() {

    root
}

fn search_suffix_tree(node: &Node, pattern: &str) -> bool {
    let mut current_node = node;

    for c in pattern.chars() {
        match current_node.children.get(&c) {
            Some(next_node) => current_node = next_node,
            None => return false,
        }
    }

    true
}

fn main() {
    let text = "banana";
    let pattern = "ana";
    let suffix_tree = build_suffix_tree(text);

    if search_suffix_tree(&suffix_tree, pattern) {
        println!("Pattern '{}' found in text '{}'", pattern, text);
    } else {
        println!("Pattern '{}' not found in text '{}'", pattern, text);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation, the <code>build_suffix_array</code> function generates all suffixes of the text, sorts them lexicographically, and stores their starting indices in the suffix array. The <code>binary_search_suffix_array</code> function then uses binary search on this array to determine whether the pattern exists in the text. The combination of sorting and binary search provides an efficient way to perform substring searches, with applications in tasks such as searching for patterns in genomic sequences or large textual datasets.
</p>

### 34.3.3. Aho-Corasick Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a multi-pattern string matching algorithm that builds a finite state machine (FSM) to search for multiple patterns simultaneously. This algorithm is particularly efficient for applications where multiple patterns need to be searched within a text, such as in intrusion detection systems or DNA sequence analysis. The Aho-Corasick algorithm constructs a trie of the patterns and then augments it with failure links, which allow the algorithm to efficiently skip portions of the text when a mismatch occurs. The preprocessing phase, which builds the FSM, runs in $O(m)$ time, where mmm is the sum of the lengths of all patterns. The matching phase, which searches the text using the FSM, runs in $O(n)$ time, where nnn is the length of the text.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation, the <code>build_trie</code> function constructs a trie from the set of patterns. The <code>build_failure_links</code> function augments this trie with failure links that guide the algorithm when mismatches occur. Finally, the <code>search_aho_corasick</code> function uses the constructed FSM to search the text for occurrences of any of the patterns. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is particularly powerful for use cases where multiple patterns need to be found in a single pass through the text, such as in keyword search engines or network intrusion detection.
</p>

### 34.3.4. Bitap Algorithm
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Bitap algorithm is an approximate string matching algorithm that uses bitwise operations to efficiently perform searches. The algorithm is particularly useful for fuzzy searching, where exact matches are not required, and the text may contain minor errors or differences from the pattern. The Bitap algorithm represents each character of the pattern as a bitmask and uses these masks to simulate the pattern matching process. The time complexity of the Bitap algorithm is $O(n \times m)$ for exact matches, where nnn is the length of the text and mmm is the length of the pattern. However, it is often more efficient than this in practice, especially for approximate matches.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Bitap:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Bitap(text, pattern, max_errors)
    pattern_mask = create_bitmasks(pattern)
    current_state = ~0
    for i = 0 to n - 1
        current_state = (current_state << 1) | pattern_mask[text[i]]
        if current_state & (1 << m - 1) == 0
            print "Pattern found at index", i - m + 1
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn bitap_search(text: &str, pattern: &str, max_errors: usize) -> Vec<usize> {
    let m = pattern.len();
    let n = text.len();
    let mut pattern_mask = vec![!0; 256];

    for (i, c) in pattern.chars().enumerate() {
        pattern_mask[c as usize] &= !(1 << i);
    }

    let mut current_state = !0;
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for i in 0..n {
        current_state = (current_state << 1) | pattern_mask[text.as_bytes()[i] as usize];
        if current_state & (1 << (m - 1)) == 0 {
            results.push(i + 1 - m);
        }
    }

    results
}

fn main() {
    let text = "hello world";
    let pattern = "world";
    let max_errors = 0;

    let matches = bitap_search(text, pattern, max_errors);
    for match_index in matches {
        println!("Pattern found at index {}", match_index);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Rust implementation, the <code>bitap_search</code> function first creates bitmasks for the pattern. The main loop then iterates through the text, updating the <code>current_state</code> based on bitwise operations that simulate the matching process. If a match is found, the function records the starting index of the match. The Bitap algorithm is especially useful in scenarios where approximate matching is needed, such as in spell-checking or DNA sequence analysis.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These advanced string matching algorithms offer powerful tools for handling complex string processing tasks, providing both efficiency and flexibility across a wide range of applications.
</p>

## 34.4. Conclusion
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of Rust, it's essential to approach the material with a clear strategy that balances conceptual understanding with practical implementation. String matching is a fundamental topic in computer science, crucial not only in text processing but also in areas like bioinformatics, search engines, and security. The following prompts and self-exercises are designed to push the boundaries of your understanding and skills in string matching algorithms, particularly within the powerful and efficient Rust programming language.
</p>

### 34.4.1. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To truly grasp these algorithms, start by deeply understanding the problem they solve: identifying and locating patterns within strings. Comprehend why different algorithms exist and what specific problems they are optimized for. For instance, understand the inefficiencies of the Naive algorithm and how the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm overcomes these by preprocessing the pattern to skip unnecessary comparisons.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In learning these algorithms using Rust, you should first focus on how Rustâ€™s unique features, such as ownership, borrowing, and slices, can be leveraged to write efficient and safe implementations. Begin by implementing the simpler algorithms, such as Naive string matching, to get comfortable with Rustâ€™s string handling capabilities. Pay attention to how Rust manages memory, especially with large texts and patterns, as this will help you appreciate Rustâ€™s advantages in writing high-performance code. When you move on to more complex algorithms like KMP or Boyer-Moore, carefully implement the preprocessing steps, such as building the prefix table or bad character table, using Rustâ€™s collections like <code>Vec</code> and <code>HashMap</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
As you progress to advanced algorithms like Suffix Trees and Suffix Arrays, take advantage of Rust's libraries and crates. For instance, consider using crates that simplify the construction of these data structures, but also try implementing them from scratch to understand their inner workings fully. Pay close attention to how Rustâ€™s iterator and pattern matching features can be used to enhance the efficiency and clarity of your code. Moreover, practice multi-pattern matching algorithms like Aho-Corasick by implementing them in Rust, using the languageâ€™s concurrency model to handle large-scale data efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, constantly test your implementations with varied and large datasets to observe their performance in real-world scenarios. Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees will assist in catching bugs early, but you should also focus on optimizing your code for speed and memory usage. By the end of this chapter, you should not only be able to implement these algorithms effectively in Rust but also understand the trade-offs between different string matching approaches and when to use each. This deep technical understanding, combined with practical coding skills, will be invaluable as you apply these algorithms in complex, real-world applications.
