# 33.1. Introduction to Polynomials
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In mathematical analysis and computer science, polynomials serve as fundamental building blocks in various algorithms and computations. A polynomial is a mathematical expression composed of variables, coefficients, and exponents, all combined using the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The standard form of a polynomial is typically represented as $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n$, where $a_i$ are coefficients and $x$ is the variable. The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable $x$ that appears with a non-zero coefficient. For example, in the polynomial $P(x) = 4 + 3x + 7x^2$, the degree is 2, corresponding to the term $7x^2$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The properties of polynomials, such as their degree and the nature of their coefficients, play a crucial role in determining their behavior and the complexity of operations performed on them. Understanding these properties is essential for effectively implementing polynomial algorithms in Rust, especially when optimizing for performance in large-scale computations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Polynomials are subject to various operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each of which requires careful handling of their coefficients and terms.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Addition and Subtraction:</strong> These operations involve combining like terms, which are terms with the same degree. The coefficients of these terms are either added or subtracted, depending on the operation. For instance, adding $3x^2 + 2x + 1$ and $4x^2 + 5x + 6$ results in $(3+4)x^2 + (2+5)x + (1+6) = 7x^2 + 7x + 7$. This operation is relatively straightforward but requires attention to ensure that coefficients of corresponding terms are correctly combined.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiplication:</strong> Multiplying polynomials is a more involved process that uses the distributive property. Each term of one polynomial is multiplied by each term of the other, and the results are then combined by adding like terms. For example, multiplying $(x + 2)$ by $(x + 3)$ results in $x^2 + 5x + 6$. In Rust, implementing this operation efficiently often involves using nested loops or leveraging optimized libraries that can handle large polynomial products.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Division:</strong> Polynomial division can be performed using methods such as polynomial long division or synthetic division. These techniques divide a polynomial by another, yielding a quotient and a remainder. Polynomial division is essential in algorithms that require factorization or when simplifying expressions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Evaluating polynomials at specific values of $x$ is a common task in numerical methods and various applications. The naive approach would involve directly computing each term and summing them, but this can be computationally expensive for high-degree polynomials.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hornerâ€™s Method:</strong> Horner's method offers a more efficient way to evaluate polynomials by restructuring the polynomial to minimize the number of multiplications and additions. It rewrites the polynomial $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n$. This reduces the complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ operations, making it particularly useful in high-performance computing and real-time applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Interpolation is the process of constructing a polynomial that passes through a given set of points. This technique is widely used in numerical analysis, data fitting, and computer graphics.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lagrange Interpolation:</strong> Lagrange interpolation constructs a polynomial by summing up Lagrange basis polynomials, each of which is designed to be 1 at one of the given points and 0 at all others. The resulting polynomial precisely passes through the provided set of points. Although straightforward, Lagrange interpolation can be computationally intensive for a large number of points, making it crucial to consider optimized implementations in Rust.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Newtonâ€™s Divided Differences:</strong> This method provides a more efficient way to build an interpolating polynomial incrementally. It calculates coefficients based on divided differences, which allows the polynomial to be constructed in a recursive manner. This technique is advantageous for numerical computations as it reduces the overall complexity and improves accuracy in floating-point arithmetic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The efficiency of polynomial operations is tightly linked to their complexity, which is primarily determined by the degree of the polynomials involved. Basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication generally have polynomial-time complexity, making them feasible for implementation in many algorithms. However, as the degree of the polynomial increases, the complexity of operations such as multiplication and interpolation can grow significantly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, careful consideration must be given to optimizing these operations, particularly when working with high-degree polynomials or large datasets. Techniques like Hornerâ€™s method and Newtonâ€™s divided differences can help mitigate the computational burden, but a deep understanding of both the mathematical properties of polynomials and Rustâ€™s computational model is essential to achieving optimal performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, polynomials are a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics, with applications that range from basic arithmetic operations to complex interpolations. Their efficient implementation in Rust requires a thorough understanding of their properties, operations, and the computational complexity involved. By mastering these concepts, one can harness the full power of Rust to handle even the most demanding polynomial computations with precision and efficiency.
</p>

# 33.2. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a cornerstone algorithm in the fields of signal processing, image analysis, and numerous other applications where the transformation of data from the time domain to the frequency domain is required. At its core, FFT is an efficient method to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with these transformations. The DFT itself is a mathematical technique that decomposes a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. However, the direct computation of DFT is computationally expensive, with a complexity of $O(N^2)$. The FFT revolutionized this process by reducing the complexity to $O(N \log N)$, making it feasible to apply Fourier analysis to large datasets and in real-time processing scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The purpose of FFT extends beyond merely being a faster way to compute the DFT. By converting a polynomial from the time domain to the frequency domain, FFT enables operations that are more efficient in the frequency domain than in the time domain. For example, convolution, a fundamental operation in signal processing, becomes a simple multiplication in the frequency domain. This efficiency gain is crucial in applications such as filtering, image processing, and even in solving partial differential equations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The mathematical foundation of FFT is rooted in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is defined for a sequence $x[n]$ of $N$ complex numbers. The DFT transforms this sequence into another sequence $X[k]$, where each element $X[k]$ represents the amplitude and phase of a specific frequency component in the original sequence. Mathematically, the DFT is expressed as:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
$$X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}$$
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, $k$ ranges from $0$ to $N-1$, and the term $e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}$ represents the complex exponential, which can be interpreted as a rotation in the complex plane. The direct computation of this sum for all $k$ requires $O(N^2)$ operations, as each $X[k]$ is a sum of $N$ terms, and there are $N$ different $k$ values.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
FFT achieves a reduction in complexity by exploiting the symmetry and periodicity properties of the complex exponentials involved in the DFT. By reorganizing the computation, FFT reduces the number of required operations to $O(N \log N)$. This reduction is achieved by dividing the original DFT into smaller DFTs, a process that lies at the heart of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Cooley-Tukey algorithm is the most widely used FFT algorithm, and it operates by recursively breaking down a DFT of any composite size $N$ into smaller DFTs. The algorithm is particularly efficient when $N$ is a power of 2, a case that is handled by the Radix-2 variant of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the Radix-2 algorithm, the input sequence is split into two halves: one consisting of the even-indexed elements and the other of the odd-indexed elements. These halves are then recursively processed to compute the DFTs of the smaller sequences. The results are combined using a process called "butterfly" operations, which efficiently merges the smaller DFTs into the final result.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Two common approaches for decomposing the DFT are Decimation in Time (DIT) and Decimation in Frequency (DIF). In DIT, the input sequence is divided into smaller sequences based on time-domain indices, while in DIF, the decomposition is based on frequency-domain indices. Both methods ultimately achieve the same result, but they differ in the order of operations and memory access patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing FFT in a high-performance language like Rust involves several considerations to ensure that the algorithm runs efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets. One key aspect is the careful management of complex number operations. Since FFT inherently operates on complex numbers, ensuring that these operations are optimized is crucial for performance. Rustâ€™s strong type system and support for low-level operations provide a good foundation for implementing these optimizations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Memory access patterns also play a significant role in the performance of FFT algorithms. The recursive nature of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, combined with the need to access different parts of the input sequence repeatedly, can lead to poor cache utilization if not managed carefully. Optimizing memory access to take advantage of Rustâ€™s ownership model and minimizing cache misses are essential for achieving the best possible performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, parallelism can be exploited in FFT implementations, as many of the smaller DFTs in the decomposition process can be computed independently. Rustâ€™s concurrency model, with its focus on safe parallelism, is particularly well-suited for implementing parallel FFT algorithms, allowing for significant speedups on multi-core processors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, the Fast Fourier Transform is a powerful algorithm that transforms data from the time domain to the frequency domain, enabling efficient computation of operations that are otherwise computationally expensive. Its mathematical foundation in the Discrete Fourier Transform, combined with the algorithmic efficiency of the Cooley-Tukey and Radix-2 methods, makes it indispensable in modern computational tasks. Implementing FFT in Rust requires careful consideration of complex number operations, memory access patterns, and parallelism to fully leverage Rustâ€™s performance capabilities.
</p>

# 33.3. Applications of FFT and Polynomials
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and polynomials are not merely theoretical constructs but have significant practical applications across various domains such as signal processing, image processing, and numerical methods. In this section, we will explore how these concepts can be applied to real-world problems, supported by pseudo codes and Rust implementations.
</p>

## 33.3.1. Signal Processing
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the primary applications of FFT is in signal processing, where it plays a crucial role in filtering and spectrum analysis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Filtering:</strong> In signal processing, filters are used to isolate specific frequencies or to remove noise from a signal. The process involves transforming the signal into the frequency domain using FFT, where filters can be applied by manipulating the signal's spectrum. The filtered signal is then transformed back into the time domain using the inverse FFT.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function FFT_Filter(signal, filter):
    transformed_signal = FFT(signal)
    filtered_signal = transformed_signal * filter
    return IFFT(filtered_signal)
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};

fn fft_filter(signal: &mut [Complex<f64>], filter: &[Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
    let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(signal.len());
    let ifft = planner.plan_fft_inverse(signal.len());

    fft.process(signal);

    // Apply the filter in the frequency domain
    for i in 0..signal.len() {
        signal[i] *= filter[i];
    }

    // Transform back to the time domain
    let mut filtered_signal = signal.to_vec();
    ifft.process(&mut filtered_signal);

    filtered_signal
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Spectrum Analysis:</strong> Another common application of FFT in signal processing is spectrum analysis, where the frequency content of a signal is examined to identify patterns or anomalies. This can be critical in areas like communications, audio processing, and even in medical diagnostics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Pseudo Code:</strong>
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Spectrum_Analysis(signal):
    transformed_signal = FFT(signal)
    spectrum = calculate_magnitude(transformed_signal)
    return spectrum
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};

fn spectrum_analysis(signal: &mut [Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<f64> {
    let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
    let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(signal.len());

    fft.process(signal);

    // Calculate magnitude spectrum
    signal.iter().map(|c| c.norm()).collect()
}
{{< /prism >}}
## 33.3.2. Image Processing
<p style="text-align: justify;">
FFT is also widely used in image processing, particularly for tasks such as filtering, enhancement, and compression.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Image Filtering and Enhancement:</strong> In image processing, convolution operations are frequently used for tasks like blurring, sharpening, and edge detection. FFT allows these convolutions to be performed efficiently by converting the image and the filter into the frequency domain, performing a point-wise multiplication, and then converting the result back to the spatial domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Image_Filtering(image, filter):
    transformed_image = FFT2D(image)
    transformed_filter = FFT2D(filter)
    filtered_image = transformed_image * transformed_filter
    return IFFT2D(filtered_image)
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use image::{GrayImage, Luma};
use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};

fn image_filtering(image: &mut [Complex<f64>], filter: &[Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
    let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(image.len());
    let ifft = planner.plan_fft_inverse(image.len());

    fft.process(image);

    // Apply the filter in the frequency domain
    for i in 0..image.len() {
        image[i] *= filter[i];
    }

    // Transform back to the spatial domain
    let mut filtered_image = image.to_vec();
    ifft.process(&mut filtered_image);

    filtered_image
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Compression:</strong> Image compression techniques, such as JPEG, often rely on FFT-based transforms like the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). These transforms reduce the image size by transforming it into a frequency domain where redundant or less important frequency components can be discarded.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Image_Compression(image):
    transformed_image = DCT2D(image)
    compressed_image = discard_low_energy_coefficients(transformed_image)
    return compressed_image
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn image_compression(image: &mut [f64]) -> Vec<f64> {
    // Assuming a DCT implementation is available
    let transformed_image = dct_2d(image);
    
    // Discard low-energy coefficients
    transformed_image.iter().map(|&c| if c.abs() > threshold { c } else { 0.0 }).collect()
}
{{< /prism >}}
## 33.3.3. Polynomial Multiplication
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Polynomials can be multiplied efficiently using FFT by transforming them into the frequency domain, performing point-wise multiplication, and then transforming the result back to the time domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Fast Polynomial Multiplication:</strong> Direct polynomial multiplication has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, but using FFT, this can be reduced to $O(n \log n)$. The key idea is to represent the polynomials as sequences of their coefficients, apply FFT to transform these sequences into the frequency domain, perform the multiplication, and then apply the inverse FFT to obtain the result.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Fast_Polynomial_Multiplication(poly1, poly2):
    n = next_power_of_two(len(poly1) + len(poly2) - 1)
    poly1 = pad_with_zeros(poly1, n)
    poly2 = pad_with_zeros(poly2, n)
    fft_poly1 = FFT(poly1)
    fft_poly2 = FFT(poly2)
    fft_result = pointwise_multiply(fft_poly1, fft_poly2)
    result = IFFT(fft_result)
    return result
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};

fn fast_polynomial_multiplication(mut poly1: Vec<Complex<f64>>, mut poly2: Vec<Complex<f64>>) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let n = poly1.len().max(poly2.len()).next_power_of_two();
    poly1.resize(n, Complex::new(0.0, 0.0));
    poly2.resize(n, Complex::new(0.0, 0.0));

    let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
    let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(n);
    let ifft = planner.plan_fft_inverse(n);

    fft.process(&mut poly1);
    fft.process(&mut poly2);

    let mut fft_result = poly1.iter().zip(poly2.iter()).map(|(&x, &y)| x * y).collect::<Vec<_>>();

    ifft.process(&mut fft_result);

    fft_result
}
{{< /prism >}}
## 33.3.4. Solving Differential Equations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
FFT is also employed in the numerical solution of differential equations, particularly when transforming the problem into the frequency domain simplifies the equation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations:</strong> Differential equations that are difficult to solve in the time domain can often be transformed into the frequency domain using FFT, where algebraic methods can be applied. After solving in the frequency domain, the solution is transformed back to the time domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Solve_Differential_Equation(eq):
    transformed_eq = FFT(eq)
    solved_eq_freq = solve_in_frequency_domain(transformed_eq)
    solution = IFFT(solved_eq_freq)
    return solution
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rustfft::{FftPlanner, num_complex::Complex};

fn solve_differential_equation(eq: &mut [Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let mut planner = FftPlanner::new();
    let fft = planner.plan_fft_forward(eq.len());
    let ifft = planner.plan_fft_inverse(eq.len());

    fft.process(eq);

    let solved_eq_freq = eq.iter().map(|&c| solve_freq(c)).collect::<Vec<_>>();

    let mut solution = solved_eq_freq.to_vec();
    ifft.process(&mut solution);

    solution
}

fn solve_freq(c: Complex<f64>) -> Complex<f64> {
    // Example: simple manipulation in frequency domain
    c * Complex::new(1.0, 0.0)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These examples demonstrate how FFT and polynomials can be applied to solve practical problems in signal processing, image processing, polynomial multiplication, and differential equations. The combination of pseudo code and Rust implementations provides a foundation for understanding and applying these techniques in real-world scenarios, leveraging the power of FFT to transform and manipulate data efficiently.
</p>

# 33.4. Optimizing FFT Algorithms
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Optimizing FFT algorithms is crucial for improving performance and efficiency, especially in applications that require handling large datasets or real-time processing. This section explores various strategies to enhance FFT implementations, from algorithmic improvements to advanced implementation techniques and considerations for numerical stability. We will also delve into specialized FFT variants that cater to specific types of data and computational needs.
</p>

## 33.4.1. Algorithmic Improvements
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Strassen's Algorithm is traditionally known for its application in matrix multiplication, but its principles can also be applied to optimize polynomial multiplication in conjunction with FFT. Strassen's approach reduces the number of arithmetic operations required, making it more efficient for large polynomials where direct multiplication is computationally expensive. By strategically partitioning the polynomials and applying FFT to each part, Strassenâ€™s Algorithm can achieve a more efficient multiplication process.

      return direct_multiplication(poly1, poly2);
  }
  
  let (low1, high1) = split_poly(poly1);
  let (low2, high2) = split_poly(poly2);
  
  let z0 = direct_multiplication(&low1, &low2);
  let z2 = direct_multiplication(&high1, &high2);
  let temp1 = add_poly(&low1, &high1);
  let temp2 = add_poly(&low2, &high2);

  let z1 = subtract_poly(&z1, &add_poly(&z0, &z2));
  
  combine_results(z0, z1, z2)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>In-place FFT:</strong> In-place FFT is an optimization technique where the FFT is computed directly within the input array, minimizing memory usage by eliminating the need for additional storage. This technique is particularly useful in memory-constrained environments or applications that require processing large data sets.

## 33.4.2. Implementation Techniques
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Caching and Memory Access Patterns:</strong> Optimizing data access patterns is crucial for reducing cache misses and improving overall performance in FFT computations. By carefully organizing data and processing it in a cache-friendly manner, significant speedups can be achieved. For example, accessing data in a sequential manner that aligns with the memory hierarchy can lead to better cache utilization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Parallelization:</strong> FFT algorithms are inherently parallelizable, making them suitable for execution on multi-core processors or GPUs. By dividing the FFT computation into independent tasks that can be executed concurrently, the overall execution time can be significantly reduced. Rust's concurrency model, with its support for safe parallelism, is well-suited for implementing parallel FFT algorithms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code for Parallel FFT:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Parallel_FFT(data):
    divide_data_into_chunks(data)
    parallel_for_each_chunk:
        perform_fft_on_chunk(chunk)
    combine_results_from_chunks()
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn parallel_fft(data: &mut [Complex<f64>]) {
    let num_threads = rayon::current_num_threads(); // Dynamically determine the number of threads
    data.par_chunks_mut(data.len() / num_threads).for_each(|chunk| {
        inplace_fft(chunk);
    });
    combine_chunks(data);
}
{{< /prism >}}
## 33.4.3. Precision and Numerical Stability
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Handling Floating-Point Precision:</strong> Floating-point arithmetic can introduce errors in FFT computations, especially when dealing with very small or very large numbers. To mitigate these errors, techniques such as Kahan summation can be used to improve the precision of the results. Additionally, careful scaling of the input and output data can help maintain numerical stability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Kahan_Summation(values):
    sum = 0
    c = 0
    for value in values:
        y = value - c
        t = sum + y
        c = (t - sum) - y
        sum = t
    return sum
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn kahan_summation(values: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let mut sum = 0.0;
    let mut c = 0.0;
    for &value in values {
        let y = value - c;
        let t = sum + y;
        c = (t - sum) - y;
        sum = t;
    }
    sum
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Dynamic Scaling:</strong> Dynamic scaling involves adjusting the scaling of the FFT computation dynamically to maintain numerical stability. This technique ensures that intermediate results do not overflow or underflow, which can lead to inaccurate results.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Dynamic_Scaling(data):
    scale_factor = calculate_scale_factor(data)
    scaled_data = data * scale_factor
    fft_result = FFT(scaled_data)
    return fft_result / scale_factor
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn dynamic_scaling_fft(data: &mut [Complex<f64>]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let scale_factor = calculate_scale_factor(data);
    data.iter_mut().for_each(|x| *x *= scale_factor);
    inplace_fft(data);
    data.iter().map(|&x| x / scale_factor).collect()
}
{{< /prism >}}
## 33.4.4. Specialized FFT Variants
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Real FFT:</strong> Real FFT optimizes FFT computations for real-valued input data by taking advantage of the symmetry properties of the Fourier transform. This optimization reduces the computational complexity by nearly half compared to the standard FFT for complex inputs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function Real_FFT(real_data):
    n = len(real_data)
    complex_data = create_complex_representation(real_data)
    fft_result = FFT(complex_data)
    return extract_real_fft_result(fft_result)
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn real_fft(real_data: &[f64]) -> Vec<Complex<f64>> {
    let n = real_data.len();
    let mut complex_data: Vec<Complex<f64>> = real_data.iter().map(|&x| Complex::new(x, 0.0)).collect();
    inplace_fft(&mut complex_data);
    complex_data[0..n / 2 + 1].to_vec()
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Multi-dimensional FFT:</strong> Extending FFT to multi-dimensional data, such as images or volumetric data, involves applying the FFT along each dimension. This extension requires careful consideration of data layout and memory access patterns to ensure efficiency and performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pseudo Code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
function MultiDimensional_FFT(data):
    for each dimension in data:
        apply_FFT_along_dimension(data, dimension)
    return data
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rust Implementation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn multidimensional_fft(data: &mut [Complex<f64>], dimensions: &[usize]) {
    for &dim in dimensions {
        for chunk in data.chunks_mut(dim) {
            inplace_fft(chunk);
        }
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
