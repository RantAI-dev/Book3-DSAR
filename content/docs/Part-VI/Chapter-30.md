## 30.1. Introduction to Cryptography
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cryptography is a cornerstone of modern data security, encompassing the techniques and principles used to protect communication and information from unauthorized access and manipulation. At its core, cryptography involves encoding data in such a way that only authorized parties can decode and understand it. The primary goals of cryptography are fourfold: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information remains secret, accessible only to those who are authorized to view it. Integrity guarantees that the data remains unchanged and unaltered during transmission or storage, thereby preserving its accuracy. Authentication verifies the identities of the parties involved in the communication, ensuring that each party is who they claim to be. Non-repudiation provides a way to prove that a party has engaged in a specific action, making it impossible for them to deny their involvement.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The origins of cryptography trace back to ancient civilizations, where simple encoding techniques were employed to secure messages. Classical ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher, represented some of the earliest cryptographic methods. Named after Julius Caesar, this cipher involved shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number, making it a rudimentary yet effective method for concealing messages. Another notable classical cipher is the VigenÃ¨re cipher, which utilized a keyword to shift letters in a more complex manner, offering greater security than its predecessors. However, the simplicity of these early techniques made them vulnerable to various forms of cryptanalysis, which eventually led to their obsolescence as more sophisticated methods were developed. The evolution from these basic ciphers to modern cryptographic techniques marks a significant advancement in the field, driven by the increasing need for robust security measures in an ever-connected world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contemporary cryptography, methods are broadly categorized into symmetric and asymmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms, also known as secret-key algorithms, use the same key for both encryption and decryption. This implies that both the sender and receiver must possess the same key and keep it secure to maintain the confidentiality of the communication. Examples of symmetric key algorithms include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES). On the other hand, asymmetric key algorithms, or public-key algorithms, utilize a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key is distributed openly, while the private key remains confidential. This approach simplifies key management and enhances security by allowing anyone to encrypt a message but only the intended recipient can decrypt it. Prominent examples include the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms. These cryptographic methods are fundamental to modern security protocols, such as HTTPS, which secures web communications, and VPNs, which protect data transmitted over public networks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In cryptography, several key terms are essential for understanding its principles and applications. A "key" is a piece of information used in algorithms to encrypt or decrypt data. The "plaintext" refers to the original, readable data before encryption, while the "ciphertext" is the transformed, unreadable output produced by the encryption process. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, making it unintelligible to unauthorized users. Conversely, decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext, making it readable again. The term "algorithm" or "cipher" refers to the set of rules or procedures used for encryption and decryption. Finally, the "keyspace" denotes the range of possible keys that can be used in a cryptographic system, influencing its strength and security.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through this comprehensive examination of cryptography, we gain insight into the complex mechanisms that safeguard our digital communications and data, illustrating the vital role cryptography plays in maintaining security in the digital age.
</p>

## 30.2. Symmetric Cryptography
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Symmetric cryptography, also known as secret-key cryptography, is a method of encryption where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data. This principle fundamentally revolves around the idea that both the sender and the recipient must possess a shared secret to securely communicate. The process involves taking plaintext, which is readable information, and transforming it into ciphertext, an encoded format that is not immediately understandable without the proper key. The recipient then uses the same key to reverse the process and recover the original plaintext. This method is efficient and computationally less intensive compared to asymmetric cryptography, making it suitable for high-performance scenarios. However, the primary challenge with symmetric cryptography lies in secure key distribution. Since the same key must be used by both parties, it must be exchanged over a secure channel to prevent interception by unauthorized entities. This necessitates the implementation of robust key distribution mechanisms to safeguard against potential breaches.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of symmetric cryptography, several algorithms have gained prominence due to their security and efficiency. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used block ciphers today. AES operates on fixed-size blocks of 128 bits and supports key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits. The strength of AES lies in its key length and its design, which incorporates multiple rounds of substitution, permutation, and mixing operations to provide strong resistance against various attacks, including brute-force attacks. As the key size increases, so does the difficulty for attackers to perform exhaustive key searches, enhancing security.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was once a dominant block cipher, operating with a 56-bit key. Despite its initial adoption, DES is now considered insecure for modern applications due to its susceptibility to brute-force attacks, where attackers systematically attempt every possible key. This vulnerability stems from advancements in computational power, which have rendered the 56-bit key insufficient to withstand such attacks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address DES's shortcomings, Triple DES (3DES) was introduced. 3DES enhances security by applying the DES algorithm three times with different keys. This process effectively increases the key length and complexity, making brute-force attacks more challenging. Despite its improvements, 3DES has been gradually phased out in favor of more secure algorithms like AES due to its slower performance and vulnerability to certain types of attacks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The effectiveness of symmetric cryptographic algorithms is further influenced by their modes of operation, which define how data is processed and encrypted. The Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is the simplest, where each block of plaintext is encrypted independently of others. While ECB is straightforward, it has significant limitations, particularly in handling larger datasets, as it can reveal patterns in the plaintext through repeated ciphertext blocks. This pattern leakage makes ECB unsuitable for many applications where data patterns need to be obscured.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contrast, the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode enhances security by incorporating feedback into the encryption process. In CBC, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This chaining effect ensures that identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertext blocks, thus masking any patterns. CBC is widely used and considered more secure than ECB, especially in scenarios where data integrity and confidentiality are crucial.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Counter (CTR) mode transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting a counter value that is incremented with each block of data. This approach allows for parallel processing of blocks, improving encryption speed and efficiency. CTR mode also provides the benefit of random access to encrypted data, making it highly versatile and suitable for scenarios where performance is critical.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Practical implementation of symmetric cryptography involves several considerations, particularly in key management and secure key exchange. Effective key management practices are essential to ensuring that keys remain confidential and are distributed securely. Protocols like Diffie-Hellman play a crucial role in facilitating secure key exchange over potentially insecure channels. Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to collaboratively generate a shared secret key without directly transmitting the key itself, leveraging the principles of mathematical functions to achieve secure communication. Ensuring robust key management and employing secure key exchange protocols are vital for maintaining the overall security and effectiveness of symmetric cryptographic systems.
</p>

## 30.3. Asymmetric Cryptography
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, represents a significant advancement in securing communications by addressing the key distribution challenge inherent in symmetric cryptography. In asymmetric cryptography, two distinct but mathematically related keys are used: a public key and a private key. The public key is freely distributed and used for encryption, while the private key is kept secret and used for decryption. This dual-key system solves the problem of securely exchanging keys over potentially insecure channels. When a message is encrypted with a recipient's public key, only the corresponding private key can decrypt it, ensuring that even if the encrypted message is intercepted, it cannot be read without the private key. Conversely, a private key can be used to encrypt a message or sign it digitally, while the public key can be used to verify the authenticity of the message or signature. This model not only enhances security but also simplifies key management, making it a cornerstone of modern cryptographic systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Among the various asymmetric algorithms, RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the most well-known and widely used. RSA's security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers into their prime factors. The algorithm involves generating two large prime numbers, computing their product to form a public key, and using this key to encrypt data. The decryption key is derived from the original primes, which remain private. RSA keys typically range from 2048 to 4096 bits in length, providing robust security against potential attacks. RSA is extensively employed for secure data transmission and digital signatures, ensuring that communications are both confidential and authenticated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is another prominent asymmetric cryptographic method that offers comparable security to RSA but with much shorter key lengths. ECC operates on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. For instance, a 256-bit ECC key provides a level of security comparable to a 3072-bit RSA key. This efficiency in key size translates into faster computations and reduced storage requirements, making ECC particularly well-suited for environments with limited resources, such as mobile devices and embedded systems. ECC's robustness and efficiency have led to its adoption in various modern applications, including secure communications and cryptographic protocols.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol is fundamental to asymmetric cryptography as it facilitates secure key exchange over an insecure channel. Developed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, this protocol allows two parties to collaboratively establish a shared secret key without having to exchange the key directly. Instead, each party generates their private key and a corresponding public key. Through a series of mathematical operations involving these keys, both parties can independently compute the same shared secret key, which can then be used for symmetric encryption. This method forms the basis for many modern key exchange protocols, ensuring secure communication between parties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Digital signatures are another critical application of asymmetric cryptography. They provide a means to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages. A digital signature is generated using a sender's private key and can be verified by others using the sender's public key. This process ensures that the message has not been tampered with and confirms the identity of the sender. RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) are commonly used for creating and verifying digital signatures. These signatures also offer non-repudiation, meaning that once a message is signed, the sender cannot deny having sent it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When implementing cryptographic systems, it is essential to consider the performance trade-offs between asymmetric and symmetric cryptography. Asymmetric algorithms, while providing critical advantages in terms of key distribution and security, tend to be slower and more computationally intensive compared to symmetric algorithms. This is because asymmetric encryption involves complex mathematical operations, such as factoring large integers or solving elliptic curve equations. In contrast, symmetric cryptography, with its single-key approach, generally offers faster processing and lower computational overhead. Consequently, asymmetric cryptography is often used for tasks such as key exchange and digital signatures, while symmetric cryptography is employed for bulk data encryption.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of asymmetric cryptography with security protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) illustrates its practical application in securing communications over the internet. These protocols utilize asymmetric cryptography for establishing secure connections between clients and servers, leveraging techniques like key exchange and digital signatures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. This integration highlights the critical role of asymmetric cryptography in contemporary security infrastructure, enabling secure online transactions, data protection, and authentication.
</p>

## 30.4. Hash Functions and Digital Signatures
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash functions are a fundamental component of modern cryptography, designed to take an input of arbitrary size and generate a fixed-size hash value, which is typically a unique representation of the input data. This process is essential for ensuring data integrity, efficient data retrieval, and cryptographic applications. Hash functions are characterized by several key properties. They are deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash value. They also need to be fast to compute, ensuring that even large datasets can be processed quickly. Pre-image resistance is a crucial property, indicating that it should be computationally infeasible to derive the original input from its hash value. Collision resistance means that it should be extremely difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. Additionally, hash functions should exhibit the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input data results in a significantly different hash value.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Among the popular hash functions, MD5 was once widely used due to its simplicity and speed. However, MD5 has been found vulnerable to collision attacks, where different inputs produce the same hash value, leading to serious security vulnerabilities. As a result, MD5 is no longer recommended for cryptographic security purposes. In contrast, SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) includes several variants such as SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. SHA-2 improves upon MD5 by offering enhanced security and resistance to collisions, making it suitable for a range of cryptographic applications. SHA-3, the latest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, is based on the Keccak cryptographic structure, providing additional security and resistance to attacks by using a different internal design from SHA-2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Digital signatures are a crucial cryptographic technique used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message. The concept behind digital signatures involves creating a unique signature for a message using a private key and allowing anyone with the corresponding public key to verify that the signature is valid and that the message has not been altered. This process ensures that the message is both genuine and intact, providing non-repudiationâ€”meaning the signer cannot deny having signed the message.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
RSA Digital Signatures use the RSA algorithm, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. The signing process involves generating a hash of the message, encrypting this hash with the private key, and attaching it to the message as the digital signature. Verification is performed by decrypting the signature with the public key and comparing it to a newly computed hash of the message. This ensures that the message has not been tampered with and confirms the identity of the sender.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) uses elliptic curve cryptography to generate and verify digital signatures. ECDSA provides similar security to RSA but with much shorter key lengths, making it more efficient in terms of computational resources. The process involves creating a digital signature using a private key and verifying it with a public key, similar to RSA, but leveraging the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to enhance security and efficiency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hash functions and digital signatures have wide-ranging applications in modern technology. In software distribution, hash functions are used to verify the integrity of downloaded files, ensuring that they have not been corrupted or tampered with. Digital signatures are employed in email verification to confirm the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the message. Blockchain technology relies heavily on hash functions and digital signatures to maintain the integrity and security of transactions, with hash functions ensuring that each block of data is linked securely to the previous one and digital signatures verifying the authenticity of transactions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's how you can implement hash functions and digital signatures in Rust using popular cryptographic libraries:
</p>

### MD5 Hash Function in Rust
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use md5;

fn main() {
    let input = b"hello world";
    let hash = md5::compute(input);
    println!("MD5 Hash: {:?}", hash);
}
{{< /prism >}}
### SHA-256 Hash Function in Rust
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};

fn main() {
    let input = b"hello world";
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(input);
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    println!("SHA-256 Hash: {:?}", result);
}
{{< /prism >}}
### SHA-3 Hash Function in Rust
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use sha3::{Sha3_256, Digest};

fn main() {
    let input = b"hello world";
    let mut hasher = Sha3_256::new();
    hasher.update(input);
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    println!("SHA-3 Hash: {:?}", result);
}
{{< /prism >}}
### RSA Digital Signatures in Rust
{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use rsa::{RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey, PaddingScheme, PublicKey}; // Import the PublicKey trait
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

fn main() {
    let mut rng = OsRng::default();

    // Generate a private key
    let private_key = RsaPrivateKey::new(&mut rng, 2048).expect("failed to generate a key");

    // Generate a public key
    let public_key = RsaPublicKey::from(&private_key);

    // Create a message
    let message = b"hello world";

    // Define the padding scheme for signing
    let padding_for_signing = PaddingScheme::new_pkcs1v15_sign(Some(rsa::hash::Hash::SHA2_256));
    let hash = Sha256::digest(message); // Properly create a hash of the message
    let signature = private_key.sign(padding_for_signing, &hash).expect("failed to sign message");

    // Define the padding scheme again for verification
    let padding_for_verification = PaddingScheme::new_pkcs1v15_sign(Some(rsa::hash::Hash::SHA2_256));
    // Verify the signature with the new padding instance
    let is_valid = public_key.verify(padding_for_verification, &hash, &signature).is_ok();
    println!("Signature valid: {}", is_valid);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In these implementations, Rustâ€™s cryptographic libraries are used to perform common tasks associated with hash functions and digital signatures. These examples demonstrate how to hash data using MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-3, as well as how to create and verify digital signatures using RSA.
</p>

## 30.5. Applications and Security Considerations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cryptography underpins many aspects of modern digital security, providing essential mechanisms to safeguard various forms of communication and data. One of the primary applications is in secure communication. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol used to secure web communications by encrypting data transmitted between a client and a server using TLS (Transport Layer Security). This ensures that sensitive information such as login credentials and personal data is protected from eavesdroppers and tampering. Similarly, email encryption tools use cryptographic techniques to protect the content of emails from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message. Secure messaging apps employ end-to-end encryption to protect the privacy of conversations, encrypting messages in transit and decrypting them only on the recipient's device.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Data integrity is another critical application of cryptography. File integrity checks use hash functions to verify that files have not been altered. For instance, software distributors often provide hash values for their files, allowing users to verify the file's integrity after download. This method ensures that files have not been tampered with or corrupted. Cryptographic techniques also play a role in software updates and version control systems, where they are used to ensure that updates are authentic and that changes to code are securely tracked and managed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Authentication mechanisms are fundamental to securing access to systems and data. Password hashing is a technique where passwords are transformed into a hash value before being stored, making it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original passwords even if they gain access to the stored hashes. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring additional verification steps beyond just passwords, such as one-time codes sent to mobile devices or biometric data. Biometric systems, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, provide a secure means of verifying user identities, leveraging unique physical characteristics that are difficult to replicate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Digital Rights Management (DRM) employs cryptographic methods to protect digital content from unauthorized access and distribution. DRM systems use encryption to control access to digital media, such as music, movies, and software, ensuring that only authorized users can view or use the content. This helps prevent piracy and unauthorized sharing of digital goods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In cryptographic practice, choosing algorithms with appropriate key lengths is crucial to ensuring security. Longer key lengths generally provide better protection against brute-force attacks, where an attacker systematically tries all possible keys to decrypt data. For instance, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key offers significantly stronger security than AES with a 128-bit key, making it more resistant to exhaustive search attacks. It is essential to use algorithms with sufficiently long keys to mitigate the risk posed by increasingly powerful computational resources.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementation issues are a critical concern in cryptographic security. Secure coding practices are vital to prevent vulnerabilities such as padding oracle attacks. These attacks exploit flaws in the way cryptographic padding is handled during encryption and decryption, potentially allowing attackers to recover plaintext from ciphertext. Implementing cryptographic algorithms correctly and securely is fundamental to maintaining their intended security properties. Common pitfalls include improper handling of cryptographic keys, inadequate randomness in key generation, and failure to update cryptographic protocols in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cryptographic protocols, such as SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), must be implemented correctly to ensure their security. SSL/TLS protocols are used to secure communication over networks, but vulnerabilities in their implementation can expose data to attacks. For example, flaws in early versions of SSL led to the development of more secure versions and updates to the protocol. Proper implementation involves not only using up-to-date versions of protocols but also configuring them correctly to avoid known weaknesses.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Looking to the future, post-quantum cryptography is an area of active research focused on developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computing threats. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic schemes currently in use, such as RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Post-quantum cryptography aims to create algorithms that remain secure in the face of quantum computational capabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Privacy enhancements, including techniques like zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption, represent advanced areas of cryptographic research. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself, providing strong privacy guarantees. Homomorphic encryption enables computations on encrypted data without requiring decryption, allowing data to remain confidential while still being processed. These techniques offer promising solutions for enhancing privacy and security in a variety of applications.
</p>

### Sample Implementations in Rust

    let client = Client::new();
    let response = client.get("https://example.com")
                         .send()
                         .await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    println!("Response Body: {}", body);
    Ok(())

    let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();
    file.read_to_end(&mut buffer)?;
    
    hasher.update(&buffer);
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    println!("SHA-256 Hash: {:?}", result);
    
    Ok(())

use argon2::{Argon2, PasswordHasher, password_hash::SaltString};
use argon2::password_hash::{PasswordHash, PasswordVerifier};

fn main() {
    let password = b"my_secure_password";
    let salt = SaltString::generate(&mut rand::rngs::OsRng);

    let argon2 = Argon2::default();
    let hashed_password = argon2.hash_password(password, &salt).expect("Failed to hash password");

    println!("Hashed Password: {:?}", hashed_password);

    // Correctly handling the string conversion to keep it alive for the lifetime of its usage
    let hash_string = hashed_password.to_string(); // Store the string result in a variable
    let parsed_hash = PasswordHash::new(&hash_string).unwrap(); // Use the variable instead of a temporary value

    // Example to verify the password against the hash
    assert!(argon2.verify_password(password, &parsed_hash).is_ok());
}

    let mut rng = OsRng::default(); // Correctly instantiate OsRng

    // Generate a private key
    let private_key = RsaPrivateKey::new(&mut rng, 2048).expect("failed to generate a key");

    // Generate a public key
    let public_key = RsaPublicKey::from(&private_key);

    // Create a message
    let message = b"hello world";

    // Hash the message using Sha256
    let hash = Sha256::digest(message);

    // Define the padding scheme for signing
    let padding_for_signing = PaddingScheme::new_pkcs1v15_sign(Some(rsa::hash::Hash::SHA2_256));

    // Sign the message
    let signature = private_key.sign(padding_for_signing, &hash.as_slice()).expect("failed to sign message");

    // Define the padding scheme for verification (recreate the padding scheme)

They illustrate the use of secure communication, data integrity, password hashing, and digital signatures, showcasing how Rust's cryptographic libraries can be used to implement these essential security features effectively.
</p>

## 30.6. Conclusion
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When studying cryptographic algorithms, leveraging Rustâ€™s features can greatly enhance your understanding and application of these concepts. Rustâ€™s strong emphasis on safety, performance, and concurrency makes it an excellent choice for implementing cryptographic algorithms and exploring their complexities.
</p>

### 30.6.1. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Start by familiarizing yourself with Rust's standard library and crates related to cryptography. For symmetric cryptography, explore crates like <code>aes</code> and <code>block-modes</code>. Implementing AES encryption using the <code>aes</code> crate will give you hands-on experience with block ciphers, while the <code>block-modes</code> crate allows you to experiment with different modes of operation such as ECB, CBC, and CTR. Implementing these algorithms from scratch in Rust will help you understand the underlying mechanisms and how different modes affect security and performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For asymmetric cryptography, delve into crates such as <code>rsa</code> and <code>ring</code>. Implementing RSA encryption and decryption with the <code>rsa</code> crate will provide practical insights into public-key cryptography and its operations. Similarly, using the <code>ring</code> crate to explore ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) will help you understand how modern cryptographic algorithms achieve security with shorter key lengths. Focus on implementing key exchange protocols like Diffie-Hellman and digital signature algorithms to solidify your grasp of asymmetric cryptography.
